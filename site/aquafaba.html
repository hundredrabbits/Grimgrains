This vicous cooking liquid is used in cooking to mimic the properties of eggs whites. Most aquafaba is made from the cooking liquid of chickpeas. It's an ideal egg replacer because it has the ability to bind and to create lift like a proper egg. It's also used in recipes as a base for gravies</p><p><b>Whipping :</b> If whipped at high speeds using an electric mixer, it's possible to create medium peaks. Adding cream of tartar can help prevent liquid loss when whipping. For every 120 ml (8 tbsp) of aquafaba (or 4 egg whites you’re replacing) add 0.6 g (⅛ tsp) of cream of tartar. It takes about 10 minutes of whipping (medium-high) to achieve medium peaks.</p><p><b>Egg replacer :</b> 15 ml (1 tbsp) of aquafaba equals 1 egg yolk, 30 ml (2 tbsp) of aquafaba equals 1 egg white and 45 ml (3 tbsp) of aquafaba equals 1 whole egg. When using aquafaba to replace whole eggs, measure out 45 ml (3 tbsp) per egg and lightly whisk to aerate. Use just as you would eggs in your recipe.

Discard soaking water and rinse the beans well. Add beans to pot, cover with 1.90 L (8 cups) of water and bring to a boil. Skim foam from top, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook chickpeas for 1h to 1h30. When thoroughly cooked, turn heat off and let cool. When cool, strain beans from cooking liquid (reserve liquid). The reserved liquid is your aquafaba. If you want a more potent liquid to be used as a binder in recipes, return liquid to a pot on the stove and cook at medium heat uncovered for 30-40 minutes. Again, let liquid cool to room temperature and transfer to refrigerator or use right away. Aquafaba is lasts for 3-4 days in the refrigerator, and 3-4 months in the freezer.</p></div><h2>chickpeas</h2><div class='small'><p>Chickpeas are the earliest cultivated legumes in history, and a staple in many countries. They are very rich in <a href='nutrition.html#protein'>protein</a>, and a good source of <a href='nutrition.html#iron'>iron</a>.</p><p> Chickpeas can be made into flour, they can be roasted, pureed, candied etc. It's a very versatile and inexpensive legume. The cooking liquid of chickpeas — <b><a href='aquafaba.html'>aquafaba</a></b> — can be used as an egg replacer in recipes.</p><p>Dry chickpeas keep a long, long time. If you keep them in air-tight containers they will last even longer, because moisture and oxygen is the enemy of all beans. Oxygen makes the bean oils rancid overtime. You can store them for 5+ yrs if you add oxygen absorbers (packet consisting of powdered <b>iron oxide</b>) to the containers.</p><p><b>How to cook dried chickpeas</b></p><p>Dried chickpeas triple in size when cooked (if not a little more). So 170 g (1 cup) of dried chickpeas will make about 510 g (3 cups) of cooked chickpeas. Dried chickpeas have a tough outer skin, and <b>should be soaked overnight</b>. Soaking them cuts down on cooking time, and in turn, saves energy. It also helps the beans cook more evenly and become tender all the way through. Another advantage to presoaking beans is that most of the gas-causing sugars are leeched out into the soaking water. So when you drain off the soaking water, you are also getting rid of this unpleasant side effect to eating beans. Next morning, drain and cook them in a pot or pressure cooker.</p><p><b>Stove top Pot:</b> Bring chickpeas to a boil, then lower to gentle simmer. Add salt when beans are almost cooked. In a pot, cooking them varies from 1-3 hours.</p><p><b>Pressure cooker:</b> Because beans cook differently depending on the kind, age, and whether or not they’ve been presoaked, quick-soaked or not soaked at all, there is no single all-encompasssing rule for pressure cooking beans. Having a good chart with all the variables to consult is important so that you can adjust to your circumstances. A good resource for this is <a href='https://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/#beans' target='_blank'>Hip Pressure Cooking’s bean chart</a>. It’s a good idea to add 1 tbsp of neutral oil to the pot. Beans produce foam when cooking which can clog the pressure valve, and the oil will help to keep that down.</p></div><ul><li><a href='brownies.html'>brownies</a></li></ul><hr/></main><footer><a href='about.html'>Grimgrains</a> © 2014—2025 <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/' target='_blank'> BY-NC-SA-4.0</a><br><a href='http://100r.ca/' target='_blank'>Hundred Rabbits</a></footer></body></html>
