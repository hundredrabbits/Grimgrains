This bread is super light and fluffy, it's great great for morning toast or sandwiches.<br /><br />I've been reading up a lot about bread, there's so many kinds out there. I wanted to understand how the ingredients we add, can change the texture of the bread. Also read about the differences in temperature, to knead or not to knead etc.<br /><br />Truth is, it depends on the type of bread you want.<br /><br /><img src='../media/recipes/basic_black_bread_1.jpg'/><br /><br />I wanted to make a sandwich bread with a light crumb, the kind that bounces back when touched.<br /><br />The one I made this time has more fat, which in turn makes it softer and fluffier. The fat that you use will also change the texture/taste of the bread. A lot of people wont like the idea of adding 'fat' to a recipe, know that fat isn't synonymous with unhealthy. Too much of it can be bad, but in moderation there really isn't anything to worry about. It also depends on what fat you choose, there are good and bad kinds of fat.<br /><br />There are many things you can do to help soften your bread, like brushing the outside with a little oil or fat. Do this as soon as you take it out of the oven, it will make the outside less crunchy. You can also substitute nut milk for the water, if you want a richer taste. There are so many different things to think about when baking!<br /><br />I made this loaf for a brunch I had with friends, we wanted to have fondue with a set I got as a gift during the holidays. We  cut the loaf into cubes, and dunked them in! Soft bread is perfect for fondue!<br /><br /><img src='../media/recipes/basic_black_bread_2.jpg'/><br /><br />So there you have it! A basic black bread!<br /><br /><b>Burger buns:</b> Repeat steps 1 to 6 in the recipe below. Instead of forming into a 'cigar' shape at step 7,divide into 8 pieces and shape into a tight ball.

Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with 15 ml (1 tbsp) of coconut oil (for browning) and put white sesame seeds on top. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes at 180 °C (350 °F). Let cool on a pile of towels or cooling rack.<br /><br /><b>Hot dog buns:</b> Repeat steps 1 to 6. Divide through into 15 pieces and shape into small cylinders (or general elongated hot dog shape). Sprinkle baking sheet with some cornmeal and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another 45 minutes in the warmed oven. Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with coconut oil.
