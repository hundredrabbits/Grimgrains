For instance, we might add only carrots, or two parsnips, or potatoes. Parnips, like carrots, are cheap and plentiful in winter. Celery is common in chili recipes, but we omit it because Devine isn't a fan.<p><p><b>Beans</b>. For beans, we try and use black beans as the bulk of the recipe, but we like to add chickpeas. Chickpeas in chili is not common, but it's a legume that we always have on hand and that we both love (we don't keep pinto, or kidney beans). Swapping chickpeas for lentils would also be delicious.</p><p><b>Canned beans?</b> It is possible to use canned beans, but buying dry beans is cheaper, and means less weight on the boat. For those who insist on using cans, <b>1 drained 425 g (15 oz) can of chickpeas</b> and <b>1 drained 425 g (15 oz) cans of black beans</b> is fine for this recipe.</p><p><b>Beer?</b> Beer provides a great flavorful medium for the beans and vegetables to simmer in, it adds depth of flavor. Dark, stouts and amber beer lend well to chili. You can omit the broth or beer and exchange for <b>350 ml</b> of extra tomatoes and their juices.</p><p><b>Chile powder</b>.

To make your own, see <a href='chile_powder.html'>this recipe</a>.</p><p><b>Cocoa powder</b>. Adding cocoa powder is a trick we learned from making Japanese curry roux. Japanese cooks like to add chocolate. It pairs well with chili. Like beer, it adds depth to the dish.</a>.</p><p><b>Pressure cooker</b>. We use our pressure cooker to prepare our chili because it helps us save on fuel (our boat uses LPG), and because we prepare beans from dry. Adjust cooking times for your altitude.</p><p><b>Fresh tomatoes</b>. If you have plenty of chopped fresh tomatoes available, or if you can your own, you can use <b>800 g</b> (roughly 10 to 12 whole, although it depends on the kind of tomato, e.g., cherry vs roma) of chopped fresh tomatoes instead of a can.</p>");

Our recipe suggests a quick way to make chickpea tofu, which was inspired by <a href='https://www.veganricha.com/chickpea-flour-tofu/#recipe' target='_blank'>this recipe</a>. We prepared a batch of spicy, green scallion 'chickpea tofu' and coated it with breadcrumbs.</p><p>The lemon juice adds flavor to the crumbs, no need for eggs or flour.</p><p>We served these with sambal oelek, it's spicy but works well with the dish.

set_description(&chocolate_turtles, "<p>Rek's dad has always been a huge fan of the Nestle chocolate turtles. We made some for him many years ago for Christmas, he really loved it, and we decided to make some again this year to serve as a dessert for a family dinner composed mainly of non-vegans. We wanted to serve a dessert that anyone could enjoy, and that didn't use any cryptic, hard-to-find, ingredients often present in vegan desserts.</p><p>There are many recipes for vegan chocolate turtles out there, but since ours has a few variations we figured we would include it. I was curious and began to research the first mention of turtles made with dates, the oldest online entry I have found so far is <a href='https://forum.vegtalk.org/t/chocolate-pecan-turtles/2534' target='_blank'>this one</a>(2010). This doesn't mean the author was the first to think of it, but they certainly deserve some credit.</p><p><b>Dates</b>. In this recipe, we used deglet noor dates because they are good and inexpensive, but it's possible to use other varieties. If the dates are larger, refer to the weight listed in the recipe, not the number of dates. The dates sold in stores may already be pitted, if they are pitted they will weigh a little less.</p><p><b>Peanuts</b>. Use unsalted varieties. The peanuts sold in stores may or may not be pre-roasted, if not, it is possible to roast them yourself in the oven. Shelled peanuts: roast at 180°C (350°F) for 15 to 20 minutes. In shell peanunts: roast at 180°C (350°F) for 20 to 25 minutes. We used peanuts because Rek has a tree-nut allergy, it is possible to use any kind of nut, anything that will help form the head and legs of a turtle.</p><p><b>Tahini</b>. The tahini is optional, but it adds a nice flavor to the dates.</p><p><b>Coconut oil</b>. Adding coconut oil to the chocolate is optional, but it adds shine to the chocolate and makes it harden more readily.</p><p><b>Leftover chocolate?</b> Pour it over another piece of parchment paper, sprinkle dried fruit over it(press each fruit down into the chocolate) and then sprinkle some coarse sea salt overtop. Let the chocolate cool, and then break off pieces to eat it!</p>");

set_description(&basic_toothpaste, "<p>In the last couple of years, we've removed most pre-made cleaning and hygiene products from our lives. In fact, we don't use shampoo at all anymore. We make our own toilet cleaner, kitchen cleaner, and we also make our own toothpaste.</p><p>Chances are you already have all of the ingredients at home to make it. The recipe consists of <a href='baking_soda.html'>baking soda</a>, <a href='coconut_oil.html'>coconut oil</a> and <a href='peppermint_oil.html'>peppermint oil</a> (food grade).</p><p>You can also brush your teeth with a simple baking soda and water mix (mix 1 tsp of baking soda with a small amount of water). Baking soda's relatively low abrasivity is enough to remove accumulations on teeth, and it rinses clear leaving a lightly salty taste. It's important to dilute the baking soda, as too much can be damaging. For those who dislike brushing with a salty taste, adding peppermint oil helps to smooth down both the taste and texture, although this ingredient is for taste, and it <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606594/' target='_blank'>isn't yet known</a> if is truly effective against oral diseases.</p><p>As for the use of coconut oil, it is thought <a href='https://www.healthline.com/health/homemade-toothpaste#recipes' target='_blank'>to reduce plaque</a> after continued use. A downside to using coconut oil, is that it becomes solid in cold climates, and it's necessary to melt it down before using it. We like to put the jar near a source of heat for 5 minutes or so. Another detail to consider, is that the oil may clog your drain in cold weather. We've noticed this on our boat, and so we spit in a glass and pour it overboard.</p><p>The ingredients in homemade toothpaste vary, some add bentonite clay and other essential oils, so we opted for the simplest recipe possible. Homemade toothpaste is controversial, as recipes lack fluoride, an ingredient that reduces cavities and that addresses other oral health conditions, but we believe that toothpaste is only as good as your brushing (which should last for a min of 2 min). It is more important to brush your teeth thoroughly than to use toothpaste, especially after eating sweets. In all, we prefer to avoid packaging and make our own, it works for us and it might work for you too.</p><p><b class='head'>Abrasion properties of baking soda</b></p><p>Tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the body, but some brands of abrasive toothpaste can wear it down, exposing the dentin lying beneath. To help quantify the abrasivity of dentifrices, researchers established a standardized scale called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(dental)#Relative_dentin_abrasivity' target='_blank'>Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA)</a>. This scale assigns toothpaste an abrasivity value, relative to a standard reference abrasive that is arbitrarily given an RDA value of 100. All dentifrices at or below 2.5 times the reference value, or 250 RDA, are considered safe and effective [1]. In fact, clinical evidence supports that lifetime use of proper brushing technique with a toothbrush and toothpaste at an RDA of 250 or less produces limited wear to dentin and virtually no wear to enamel [2]. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) has a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness' target='_blank'>Mohs hardness</a> value of 2.5 and an RDA value of 7.</p><p><b class='head'>Sources</b></p><p>[1] St John S, White DJ.

Recipe chocolate_chip_cookies = create_recipe("chocolate chip cookies", basic, "12 cookies", 20191206, 20);
set_description(&chocolate_chip_cookies, "<p>We've been making chocolate chip cookies for a while, but never thought it worthy of a recipe because there are so many online already. In the interest of posting absolute basic recipes though, we felt it deserved to be written down, especially because cookie chemistry is difficult. Slight differences in moisture content, altitude, fat content and sugar content can alter the look and texture of a cookie. There are reasons for the quantities and choice of each ingredient, all interact with each other to give cookies their sweet and soft texture.</p><p>This recipe is a good base. Substitutions are possible, but changing ingredients—depending on the ingredient—can mess up your recipe. In our suggestions we give examples of good substitutions, and how to modify the recipe to get a good result.<b class='head'>Substitutions</b> <b>Flour:</b> If you choose to use spelt flour, a more nutritious alternative, add 5 ml (5 ml) of baking powder to help it rise.</p><p><b>Fat:</b> The fat in cookies is a big part of their structure. We've added vegan butter(or margarine) as it behaves like actual butter, it helps create baked goods that are more tender by shortening gluten strands. When fat coats flour, it slows down the process of gluten formation creating a more tender product <a href='https://bakerbettie.com/function-of-butter-in-baking/#The_Function_of_Butter_in_Baking'>ref</a>. To make your own vegan butter, look for the recipe in <b>The Homemade Vegan Pantry by Miyoko Schinner</b>.</p><p><b>Sugar:</b> Sugar is important in cookies, it helps with the flavor, color and texture. The oven temperature causes the sugar to react with the proteins, this is what gives baked goods their brown color. Natural brown sugar is important in this recipe, as it adds moisture to the dough. If you use 100% granulated white sugar the cookie won't spread as well, not unless you add more moisture.</p><p><b>Add-ins:</b> If you have a sensitivity to caffeine use <a href='carob_chips.html'>carob chips</a> instead of chocolate chips. Switching to carob won't affect the cookies. <b class='head'>Troubleshooting</b>\"I followed the recipe, but my cookies don't look the same as yours!\" The quirkiness of different ovens makes it difficult to give accurate cooking times. Having a thermometer in your oven is the best way to read the temperature accurately.</p><p><b>Help! Cookie spreading too much!</b> If your cookie is spreading too much, you may have added too much sugar. Sugar is hygroscopic, it absorbs liquid but once it bakes it releases that and if there's too much, then it keeps spreading. Oven temperature is another factor. The hotter the oven, the more quickly the fat melts before the cookies have time to set. Depending on your oven, you may need to bake cookies longer but at a lower temperature.</p><p><b>Help! Cookie not spreading!</b> One of the most common reasons why cookies don't spread is because there's too much flour in the dough. Try using less, and consider increasing the commercial brown sugar by a few tablespoons. This will add slightly more moisture and help the cookies spread. Be sure you're also using room temperature ingredients, especially butter, to promote the best spread and texture.</p><p>Read more about <a href='https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2016/03/14/cookie-chemistry-2'>cookie chemistry</a>.

set_description(&chunky_apple_jam, "<p>Every fall we volunteer with a <a href='https://lifecyclesproject.ca/' target='_blank'>local organization</a> to pick apples on private property that would normally go to waste. This year we got a lot of fruit so we decided to process some. We are not huge fans of compote, but we do like chunky-style jams.</p><p><b>Apples</b></p><p>We can't say for certain what kind of apple we picked, they looked like spartans or fujis, either way they are sweet and crisp and lend well to jams.</p><p><b>Botulism?</b> In the word of <a href='https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2013/08/02/in-jams-and-jellies-acidity-is-the-key-to-avoiding-botulism' target='_blank'>Kevin West</a>, acidity is the enemy of botulism. Foods that have a pH below 4.6, high-acid foods like apples, blueberries, strawberries (and many more) are completely safe, they have sufficient natural acidity to safeguard us against the risk of botulism. Despite this, it is still necessary to process the clean jars after filling them with jam.</p><p><b>Jam doneness</b><br><p> Apples normally have enough natural pectin to gel. Is my jam ready to take off the heat? There are three methods:</p><p><b>Temperature Test:</b> Take the temperature of the jelly with a candy or jelly thermometer. When done, the temperature of the jelly should be 100°C if you are at sea level. NOTE: For each 305 m of altitude above sea level, subtract 2 degrees. For instance, at 305 m of altitude, the jelly is done at 100°C; at 610 m, 102°C, etc<p><b>Spoon or Sheet Test</b>. Dip a cool metal spoon into the boiling jelly mixture and lift the spoon out of the steam so the syrup runs off the side. When the mixture first starts to boil, the drops will be light and syrupy. As the syrup continues to boil, the drops will become heavier and will drop off the spoon two at a time. When the two drops form together and sheet off the spoon, the jellying point has been reached.</p><p><b>Refrigerator/Freezer Test</b>. Pour a small amount of boiling jelly on a plate, and put it in the freezing compartment of a refrigerator for a few minutes. If the mixture gels, it should be done. During this test, the rest of the jelly mixture should be removed from the heat <a href='https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_07/jelly_point.html' target='_blank'>[ref]</a>.</p><p><b>Sugar.</b> Adding too little sugar may cause the jam to ferment. In this recipe, we added demerara sugar (it's what we had on hand) so this why the jam is dark. We like it because it has plenty of molasses in it, lending the jam a deep and pleasant toffee-esque flavor. Feel free to use other varieties of sugar, especially if you prefer a lighter-colored jam, or if you don't like the flavor of molasses.</p><p><b>Recommended Process Time</b></p><p>When processing jars in a boiler canner, the time varies depending on the altitude where you live. For this recipe (hot pack) the recommended time for those living from  0 - 305 m (0 - 1,000 ft) is 10 minutes, but the <a href='https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_07/apple_preserves.html' target='_blank'>National Center for Food Preservation</a> recommends 5 minutes, I do the longer time to avoid having to pre-boil the jars.

set_description(&halloween_pumpkin_cookies, "<p>Been a while since we've baked cookies. It being pumpkin season, the choice was obvious.</p><p>These are not very sweet, namely because of the addition of coconut sugar which has a subtle and more complex taste. Coconut sugar will make your cookies a darker shade of orange, almost brown, and we think it fits nicely with the toned-down color of the pumpkin seeds. If you want a bold orange color, use white cane sugar instead.</p><p><b>Leftover chocolate:</b> This recipe makes more chocolate than is needed for the recipe. If you want to keep it for later, pour it in a chocolate mold or shallow container and put it in the freezer. It will become solid and you'll have delicious homemade chocolate on the side for later times! Once it's solid, pop it out of the mold and put it in a closed container. Keep it in the freezer until you're ready to eat it!</p><p>Pumpkin puree how-to: Remove seeds and stringy flesh from pumpkin. Cut the pumpkin into large chunks and place on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven at 180 °C (350 ºF). Roast pumpkin for 45 minutes until pumpkin is soft and tender. Let cool. Remove skin, and process into a food processor or use a handstick blender. If pumpkin puree is too wet, strain liquid through cheesecloth, if too dry, add a bit of water. The puree keeps for 3 days in the fridge, and up to 3 months frozen.</p>");

It is a recipe we like but that we can't prepare aboard Pino because we don't have a working oven (no way to bake the tourtière). This year, we got the idea of making Japanese-style dumplings(gyoza) but with the pot pie filling we use for tourtière. We can prepare this meal on the stovetop and it tastes amazing!</p><p>For this recipe we used pre-made dumpling wrappers, but it's possible to make the wrappers yourself: see our <a href='gyoza_wrappers.html'>gyoza wrappers recipe</a>.</p><p>The tourtière filling was based on a recipe by <a href='https://www.lacuisinedejeanphilippe.com/recipe/tourtiere-de-millet-2/' target='_blank'>Jean-Philippe</a>. A tourtière recipe that we love and make every year.</p><p><b>Cutting food small</b>. An important note for this recipe is that all vegetables need to be cut very small so they fit inside a wrapper, if cut too big you'll end up with a bunch of lumpy dumplings, or dumplings that won't close. We minced the potatoes, carrots and onions for this reason (it also means they cook down faster!).</p><p><b>Dipping sauce</b>. Typically, in Quebec, millet tourtière is served with ketchup, but we decided to make a traditional gyoza dip instead and added a hint of tomato.</p><p><b>Millet</b>. Note that I used hulled millet in this recipe, toasting the grains before boiling then enhances their flavor and makes for better texture. Millet requires a water to grain ratio of 2:1. In this recipe the millet is cooked with less liquid because it will absorb more when it is cooked again in later steps.</p>");

set_description(&okonomiyaki, "<p><b>Okonomiyaki</b> (meaning, 'grilled as you like it') is a Japanese dish, similar to the American omelette, but the main difference is the variation of ingredients. Typical okonomiyaki are made with eggs, and often include meat or fish. Making it without meat is simple enough, but without eggs? Back when we lived in Tokyo, our experience in cooking with plants was limited, but now we've been doing it long enough that we can think of alternatives with ease.</p><p>The key ingredient? <a href='chickpea_flour.html'>Chickpea flour</a>. We make chickpea pancakes, and <a href='scrambled_chickpea_flour.html'>scrambled chickpea flour</a> (resembles scrambled eggs) at home all the time. Chickpea flour is a staple on Pino, and works very well for okonomiyaki.</p><p><b>Nagaimo:</b> If you're in a place were nagaimo (or yamaimo) is available, we highly reccommend adding it to the dish. It makes a fluffier pancake. Although we've made okonomiyaki without nagaimo before, so if you can't find it know that it will work and be very delicious anyway. It imparts little flavor, all it does is add nutrition and texture. Nagaimo, unlike most potatoes, can be eaten raw. However, it is best to handle the nagaimo with gloves, or to soak the peeled tuber in a vinegar-water solution to neutralize irritant <b>oxalate crystals</b> found on their skin. Nagaimo are low-calorie, high in protein, and have potassium, zinc, vitamin C and more. The texture of grated nagaimo can be off-putting, it looks like a regular tuber when whole, but when grated it becomes slime, almost liquid. This sort of texture is well-liked in Japan and referred to as being 'neba neba' (slimy). This texture present in many other foods like okra and nattou. This texture makes it an ideal egg alternative, it can be used to make deserts when baking.</p><p><b>Aonori:</b> Aonori is another obscure ingredient, but again, it can be omitted, although it tastes really amazing with it. We made okonomiyaki without it when we were in Majuro, because it simply wasn't available, so we used finely cut nori instead. Obviously, this isn't a perfect substitution, because aonori is sweet and tastes nothing like nori. However, nori is still very delicious and pairs well enough with the okonomiyaki.</p><p><b class='head'>Okonomi sauce</b></p><p>In this recipe, we don't use true 'okonomi sauce'. Why? Because we don't use many pre-made sauces, we prefer to make our own. Okonomi sauce requires many ingredients, and honestly, the sauce we've made works really well in this recipe and makes a good okonomi sauce alternative.</p><p>If you want to make your own, you can mix 7g (1 1/2 tsp) <a href='#whole_can_sugar.html'>sugar</a>, 45g (3 tbsp) <b>ketchup</b> and 45g (3 tbsp) of vegan <b>worcestershire sauce</b>.

set_description(&whole_wheat_pancakes, "<p>We like to prepare pancakes aboard Pino, especially when we run out of bread for our morning peanut butter toast ritual. Like bread and cookies, there are several key rules to making good pancakes. In the following notes we have tried to outline these rules as clearly and as thoroughly possible.</p><p><b>Baking powder</b>. If you want to double the recipe, keep in mind that the baking powder to flour ratio is 5-6.25 g (1 tsp to 1 1/4 tsp) baking powder for every 125 g (1 cup) of flour. The leavening power of baking powder can weaken overtime. To test that the baking powder is still good, drop a teaspoonful into a cup of hot water, if bubbles are visible right away it's still good, if not, replace the baking powder.</p><p><b>Wheat Berries</b>. We have a grain mill onboard and grind our own red wheat berries to make flour. Freshly-ground flour tastes better, fresher. If you buy whole wheat flour from the store keep in mind that it will oxidize quicker than white flour because whole wheat flours still have the bran and germ.<p><b>All-purpose flour</b>. If you're not comfortable using whole wheat flours, it's possible to use all-purpose flour but when mixing in the liquids be careful not to overmix. Mixing helps develop elastic gluten to help pancakes rise, but when baking soda or baking powder is used for leavening, overmixing makes the gluten so thick that air bubbles can't expand, resulting in a tough chewy pancake. If you are new to using whole wheat flour work your way up slowly, gradually replacing more and more of the all-purpose ﬂour with whole grain ﬂour.</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/whole_wheat_pancakes2.jpg'/> The above photo shows pancakes made with 50&#37; all-purpose flour and 50&#37; whole wheat. </p><p><b>Orange juice</b>. For those not used to the taste of whole wheat, replace 30-45ml (2-3 tbsp) of the liquid in the recipe with orange juice. The citrus helps to temper the ﬂavor of whole wheat (a recommendation by P.J. Hamel of King Arthur Flour).</p><p><b>Vanilla extract</b>. While optional, vanilla extract can lend a good flavor to pancakes, see <a href='https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2019/06/25/how-to-make-vanilla-extract'>how to make your own</a>.</p><p><b>Baking powder & baking soda</b>. When a recipe contains baking powder and baking soda, the baking powder does most of the leavening. The baking soda is added to neutralize the acids in the recipe plus to add tenderness and some leavening[<a href='https://joyofbaking.com/printpages/bakingsodaprint.html' target='_blank'>Source</a>].</p><p><b>Sourdough pancakes?</b> Mix the following ingredients and let rest overnight: 240 g (1 cup) unfed <a href='sourdough_starter.html'>sourdough starter</a>, 224 g (1 cup) buttermilk(1 cup soy milk plus a curdling agent, like vinegar or lemon juice), 120 g (1 cup) whole wheat flour and 13 g (1 tbsp) sweetener. The next day before cooking the batter, add 2.5 ml (1 tsp) of vanilla extract, 3 g (1/2 tsp) salt and 6 g (1 tsp) baking soda. It's possible to use sourdough discard to make pancakes (no need to let it rest overnight), but be sure to add baking powder and baking soda to help it rise, the discard won't provide much leavening but helps to use it up while providing flavor.</p>");

We are settled in, but one thing remains difficult for us: finding fresh produce. The vegetables in Majuro are imported from either Guam, or Hawaii by cargo ship, and because they spend much time at sea they are frozen. Freezing fresh whole vegetables is never a good idea, the vegetables rot before they make it onto the shelves. When possible, we opt for local produce. Majuro has few native fresh vegetables, but they do have some fruit and among these is <b>the pandanus fruit</b>.</p><p>Pandanus, or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandanus_tectorius' target='_blank'>Pandanus tectorius</a>, bears a fruit that look like a giant pinecone, it is made up of little wedge-like phalanges, commonly referred to as 'keys'. Each fruit has about 40-80 keys, the part of the keys that is attached to the core is soft, and a bright orange colour. In the Marshall Islands, people suck on the orange part which is sweet and tastes of cane sugar. The soft part can also be cut, and processed into juice. It is possible to make the juice yourself, this <b><a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/pandanus.html' target='_blank'>blog post</a></b> explains the process at length.</p><p>I don't have the space, nor the tools to prepare pandanus juice, but a store in Majuro sells frozen purée. This is what I used to prepare this pandanus fruit cake and the topping that goes with it. What does it taste like? It is similar to mango, sweet, but also bitter.</p><p>I bought a generous portion of frozen pandanus purée, and couldn't use most of it in the bread so we used the rest to make a topping. The chia seeds don't act as a thickener and can be omitted, but they add nutritional value to the meal.</p><p>If you ever come across some pandanus fruit, please try it! Making pandanus juice from scratch requires some muscle and serious dedication, but in places where it grows, chances are you'll also find a 'processed' version.</p>");

set_description(&sourdough_starter, "<p>Sourdough bread has been around for a long time. People are still making it today, even with the existence of baker's yeast.</p><p>The fermentation required to prepare it improves the flavor of the dough, and makes it easier for the body to absorb the <a href='nutrition.html#zinc'>dietary minerals</a> present in the grains.</p><p>Making sourdough bread begins with a sourdough starter. The starter is a fermenting mixture of flour and water containing microorganisms which include wild yeast and lactobacilli. The yeast produces carbon dioxide which leavens the dough, and the lactobacilli produce lactic acid which contribute flavor. The process is simple, it requires more waiting than active cooking time. We've made a summary of common questions and concerns when it comes to making a starter.</p><p><b><a id='discard'>WHY DISCARD?</a></b></p><p>Discarding starter is necessary as it quickly builds up in a jar and becomes difficult to manage. The discard works well in a variety of baked goods.</p><p><b>ADAPTING YEAST RECIPES</b></p><p>There are some key aspects to converting yeast recipes to sourdough, like hydration level and yeast. <a href='https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/sourdough/hydration-sourdough-starter/' target='_blank'>Hydration level</a> is the ratio of water to flour in a starter. You can maintain or adjust the hydration level with each feeding based on the ratio of water to flour you feed your starter. Aiming for 100% hydration, or equal weights of flour and water, is recommended.</p><p>To calculate how much added yeast is necessary, first you have to know that the rising power of 7 g of yeast (1 packet) is roughly equivalent to 226 g (1 cup) of sourdough starter.</p><p>With this information it's easy to approximate the amount of added water, flour and yeast in a recipe.</p><p><b>FEEDINGS</b></p><p>The starter needs feedings at <b>12 h intervals daily</b> in the first week, and <b>once a day afterwards</b>. As long as this starter culture is fed flour and water regularly it will remain active.</p><p><b>I forgot to feed my starter!</b> Forgetting to feed the starter isn't a big deal, feed it as soon as you remember. Feedings of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem.<br /><b>Did i feed my starter too much?</b> Feeding the wrong amount won't kill it, but it may make it appear too dry or too wet and may not rise as expected. You can correct the feeding by adding either more flour or water, it will right itself.<br /><b>Liquid on top of my starter?</b> This liquid is the alcohol given off as the wild yeast ferments. This doesn't mean it's going bad, it indicates that your starter is hungry.</p><p><b>FLOUR</b></p><p>Using wholemeal instead of processed flour for your starter is a good idea because it provides a variety of organisms and minerals.</p><p><b>FILTERED WATER</b></p><p>Using filtered (carbon filter) or distilled water instead of plain tap ensures good fermentation, as sourdough relies on microorganisms that chlorine inhibits. Leaving tap water uncovered for 24 h will allow the chlorine to dissipate.</p><p><b>Can my starter go bad?</b> Starters require more attention on the initial 6-10 days it takes to create a healthy mature starter. It hasn't yet developed defenses that characterize a mature starter. Mature starter cultures are stable because of their pH level and the presence of antibacterial agents, this helps prevent colonization by unwanted yeasts and bacteria. Sourdough breads keep fresh longer than regular bread for this reason too. The ideal temperature for starters is 21 °C, but a bit higher and lower won't hurt it. Yeast dies at 60 °C. If you see an pink or orange streak on your starter, this is a sure sign it's gone bad, discard and start over.</p><p><b>Smaller starter?</b> Because I don't bake often and that I don't want too much discard, I keep a very small batch of sourdough: 20g (4 tsp) water to 20g (2 tbsp) flour. The only downside is that it takes a lot longer to build enough starter to bake with.</p>");

It is not necessary to proof the yeast, you can add it directly in the flour, but in this recipe I proof my instant yeast because it is a way to ensure that the yeast is still active(it won't bloom if it isn't).</p><p><b>Cheese</b>. We don't overcomplicate things when making cheese for pizza, we like having a runny cheesy sauce, but there are <a href='https://www.noracooks.com/shreddable-vegan-mozzarella/' target='_blank'>other recipes</a> out there for melty, shreddable, plant-based cheeses. Note that the cheese won't melt unless you pop the pizza and toppings back into the cast iron pan on the stovetop at medium-high heat for an additional 5-10 minutes with a lid on.</p><p><b>Flour</b>. Evidently, it is possible to replace the portion of whole wheat flour with 100&#37; all-purpose.</p><p><b>Oven version</b>. To cook these pizzas in the oven, don't pre-cook the dough, lay it out in the desired shape(circle, or rectangle), add the toppings and bake at 230 °C (450 °F) for 15-20 minutes.

set_description(&sweet_mock_eel_nigiri, "<p>Burmese tofu is made with chickpea flour, one of our staple foods. We first learned about this kind of tofu by reading The Burmese Kitchen by Aung Thein. The process for making this kind of tofu is usually much longer, if you're interested in making it the correct way the process is described at length on <a href='https://www.netcooks.com/recipes/Salads/Burmese-Style.Tofu.html' target='_blank'>this page</a>(which was copied digitally from The Burmese Kitchen). Our recipe suggests a quick way to make chickpea tofu, which was inspired by <a href='https://www.veganricha.com/chickpea-flour-tofu/#recipe' target='_blank'>this recipe</a>. It's a great soy-free alternative, and the texture is comparable to that of soft tofu.</p><p><b>Note</b>: This recipe will use up about half of the burmese tofu, which means you'll have a whole other half to use in other meals.</p><p>We thought the chickpea tofu would be well-suited as a 'mock unagi kabayaki', and that it would look especially striking atop some black rice.</p><p>The sauce served over unagi (eel) kabayaki is sweet, with hints of caramel. Most Japanese sauces are easy to make, and usually require around 3-4 ingredients, these almost always include: soy sauce, sake, mirin, or Japanese rice vinegar. If you want to cook Japanese food, having these around is a must.</p><p><b>Besan flour</b>. In this recipe I use chickpea flour, ground from whole dry chickpeas(garbanzo beans), besan/gram flour comes from ground brown chickpeas(sometimes peas too) and usually comes out finer, smoother when ground into flour. If using besan(gram) flour, remove 60 ml of water, or add 1/4 cup of flour. It's also possible to make chickpea tofu by soaking the beans, to blend them and to use that to make the batter(cooked, of course).</p><p><b>Thicker chickpea tofu.</b>. If you prefer a firmer chickpea tofu, use 450 ml of vegetable broth instead of 500 ml.</p><p><b>Inorganic arsenic(iAs)</b>. Rice can be a significant source of iAs, especially brown rice because it is concentrated in the outer bran layer(bran is removed in white rice). Cooking the rice in excess water, say using a 1:6 rice to water ratio, reduces iAs up to 60 percent. [<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>]. How to cook the rice?<br><b>Method 1:</b> Boil 4 cups(1 cup of water for every cup of rice), add rice and boil for 5 minutes, discard the water, add 1 1/2 cups of fresh water back to the pot with the rice and bring to a boil, then lower to medium and cook until the water is absorbed.<br><b>Method 2:</b> Regardless of the kind of rice you are cooking, bring a pot-full of water to a boil, add the rice and cook it like pasta(15 minutes boiling time for basmati), then drain the water out.<br>Note that soaking rice is also a good way to reduce iAs, but cooking the rice in excess water is a better approach.</p>");

set_description(&seitan, "<p><b>Seitan</b> (say-tan) or <b>wheat meat</b>, is very meat-like, it's prepared using a variation of spices and other seasonings. It is the base of Buddhist vegetarian cooking, and has been documented in China since the 6th century. It's an ingredient that is also present in Japanese cuisine, for <b>Shojin Ryori</b> (vegetarian cooking)—an important term to remember if you don't eat meat and are traveling there. Seitan takes on a different name there, it is known as <b>Fu</b>, and can be found in two forms: raw (nama-fu) or dry-baked (yaki-fu, which looks like bread).</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/seitan_2.jpg'/></p><p>Seitan, or Fu, can be produced at home, but it's very labor intensive. Making it requires kneading wheat flour with water to rinse out the starch from the wheat, what remains is a sticky mass of pure gluten protein. If your plan is to make it from scratch, good on you, but otherwise, <a href='gluten_flour.html'>gluten flour</a> (or vital wheat gluten) is your best bet. The basic ingredients for seitan are gluten flour and water, but it's best to flavor it with other ingredients as it is rather bland on its own. The amount of liquid that you use to make your dough will also affect the chewiness of your seitan, less waters means more chewy with a harder texture, and more will make it tender.</p><p>In this recipe, we added chickpea flour for added nutrition. Wheat gluten proteins are deficient in lysine (an essential amino acid for good health), adding a lysine-rich food like chickpea flour to the mix makes up for this deficiency.</p><p>When preparing seitan, it's important to flavor both the inside and outside of the dough. Adding a variation of ingredients to the dough mix such as <a href='ginger.html'>ginger</a>, <a href='garlic.html'>garlic</a>, <a href='onion_powder.html'>onion powder</a>, <a href='tomato_sauce.html'>tomato sauce</a>, <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a> and so on will make it extra flavorful, the same goes for the broth. Adding vegetable broth and <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a> as a base, and roughly chopped <a href='onions.html'>onions</a>, <a href='garlic.html'>garlic</a> and <a href='ginger.html'>ginger</a> will season the outside of the dough.</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/seitan_4.jpg'/></p><p>There are <b>3 ways</b> to cook seitan: <b>boiling, steaming or baking</b>. In this recipe, we used the boiling method. Steaming requires wrapping the dough in foil or some other wrapper to help it keep its shape, then steaming it in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water for 30 minutes or so. Baking the seitan, means flattening or stretching the dough to fit the baking dish, adding seasonings overtop, and baking it for an hour. All methods are good, but some are better for certain kinds of meals.</p>");

For a heartier meal, adding sweet potatoes is also delicious. Sometimes, if we're out of peanut butter, we'll use sesame paste instead, the flavor is very similar and doesn't change much in the recipe (also nice for those with peanut allergies). This recipe only works with whole lentils, because there's still a bite to them, halved lentils will soften too much and the resulting texture won't be as pleasant.</p><p>Enjoy this humble, but delicious recipe.</p><p><b class='head'>Sprouted lentils</b></p><p>If you use sprouted lentils, the cooking time is reduced by more than half. It can help you save on both time, and fuel, while making the lentils more digestible. For sprouting techniques, refer to <a href='sprouting.html#garbanzo'>lentils</a> in the sprouting guide.</p><p>The directions for the recipes will differ a bit. For this version of the recipe, cut the vegetables real small (tiny cubes) so they cook fast, then brown them in a pan with oil.

Note that short grain white rice uses a water to rice ratio of 1.25:1, but preboiling rice for 5 minutes in a 4:1 water to rice ratio and then discarding the water is best for reducing potential arsenic contamination[<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>].</p><p><b>Roux</b>. In this recipe we make a quick roux, a proper roux requires constant stirring and a longer cooking time. Keep in mind, the longer a roux is cooked the less thickening power it has, although the deeper the flavor of the roux will be (not important in this case because the roux is primarily a thickener). If you want roux with a deeper flavor, cook it for 15-20 minutes, or until it develops a dark chocolate color(keep in mind that you have to keep stirring the whole time). It's important to remember that <b>roux requires equal parts fat and flour (weight, not volume)</b>.</p><p><b>Cutting root vegetables small</b> We generally cut our root vegetables thin and small so they don't take too long to cook, it is especially important for us when relying on LPG to cook in the summer.</p><p><b>Inorganic arsenic(iAs)</b>. Rice can be a significant source of iAs, especially brown rice because it is concentrated in the outer bran layer(bran is removed in white rice). Cooking the rice in excess water, say using a 1:6 rice to water ratio, reduces iAs up to 60 percent. [<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>]. How to cook the rice?<br><b>Method 1:</b> Boil 4 cups(1 cup of water for every cup of rice), add rice and boil for 5 minutes, discard the water, add 1 1/2 cups of fresh water back to the pot with the rice and bring to a boil, then lower to medium and cook until the water is absorbed.<br><b>Method 2:</b> Regardless of the kind of rice you are cooking, bring a pot-full of water to a boil, add the rice and cook it like pasta(15 minutes boiling time for basmati), then drain the water out.<br>Note that soaking rice is also a good way to reduce iAs, but cooking the rice in excess water is a better approach.</p>");
