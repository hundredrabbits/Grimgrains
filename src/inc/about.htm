<h1>About</h1>

<p>We started <b>Grimgrains</b> to learn how to cook. This blog helps track our habits as we adapt to the locally-available produce. Our recipes are plant-based, and contain no tree nuts due to Rek's allergy. We primarily use Metric for measurements, for example 1 cup equals 250 ml.</p>

<p>We are <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/' target='_blank'>Rek Bell</a>(illustrator) and <a href='http://xxiivv.com' target='_blank'>Devine Lu Linvega</a>(developer), living on a small 10m(33ft) sailboat somewhere on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. <a href='http://100r.co' target='_blank'>HundredRabbits</a> is the name of our floating studio. We draw, write software, and concoct recipes as we sail around looking for new ingredients.</p>

<p>This website showcases our favourite creations, along with hand-drawn illustrations for each ingredient. The pages were generated entirely in the classic C99 programming language, and the sources can be found on <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Grimgrains' target='_blank'>Github</a>.</p>

<p>You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Grimgrains/archive/master.zip'>[.zip]</a> for offline viewing.</p>

<h3>Kuropanman</h3>

<p>The mascot of grimgrains is a loaf of dark bread named Kuropanman, a tribute to Anpanman (a hero with a red bean paste filled pastry for a head). I only became very interested in cooking when moving to Japan in 2012, the site came online shortly after that.</p>
