<h1>About</h1>

<p>We started <b>Grimgrains</b> to learn how to cook. This blog helps track our habits as we adapt to the locally-available produce. Our recipes are plant-based, and contain no tree nuts due to Rekka's allergy.</p>

<p>We are <a href='http://kokorobot.ca/' class='external' target='_blank'>Rekka Bellum</a>(illustrator) and <a href='http://xxiivv.com' class='external' target='_blank'>Devine Lu Linvega</a>(developer), living on a small 10 m sailboat somewhere on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. <a href='http://100r.co' class='external' target='_blank'>Hundredrabbits</a> is the name of our floating studio. We write software and concoct recipes as we sail around the world looking for new ingredients.</p>

<p>This website showcases our favourite creations, along with hand-drawn illustrations for each ingredient. The pages were generated entirely in the classic C99 programming language, and the sources can be found on <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Grimgrains' class='external' target='_blank'>Github</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any question, you can find us on <a rel='me' href='https://merveilles.town/@rek'>Mastodon</a>.</p>
