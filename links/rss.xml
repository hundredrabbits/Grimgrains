<div><p>Meals with faux-cheese doesn't always have to include nutritional yeast. We love nutritional yeast, but it's not cheap to buy, so we use it sparingly. Mixing a few other simple ingredients together we find is enough to make a good and satisfying cheesy sauce.</p><p>In the above image, we added brussel sprouts. It's not part of the recipe because it is a strange ingredient to add to mac and cheese, but we like it in everything. Whenever we cook rice, or pasta, we add halved and stemmed brussel sprouts(with the outer leaves removed) to the cooking water. If you like boiled brussel sprouts, give it a shot.</p><p><b>Substitutions</b></p><p><b>Plant milk</b>: If you don't like soy milk, any non-dairy milk will do. We've had mac and cheese with full-fat coconut milk and it was heavenly. Coconut milk alters the flavor of the faux-cheese in a very good way.</p><p><b>Miso</b>: We always have miso on the boat, and we use whatever kind we happen to have. We've made the mixture with white and red miso. The red miso has a stronger, deeper taste.</p><p><b>Turmeric</b>: turmeric is an optional ingredient, but it gives the sauce a pop of colour and it is very good for you. It's possible to use fresh turmeric, 10 g (1 tsp) of dried turmeric is equal to roughly 15g (1 tbsp) of fresh turmeric.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/mac_and_faux_cheese.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Every fall we volunteer with a <a href='https://lifecyclesproject.ca/' target='_blank'>local organization</a> to pick apples on private property that would normally go to waste. This year we got a lot of fruit so we decided to process some. We are not huge fans of compote, but we do like chunky-style jams.</p><p><b>Apples</b></p><p>We can't say for certain what kind of apple we picked, they looked like spartans or fujis, either way they are sweet and crisp and lend well to jams.</p><p><b>Botulism?</b> In the word of <a href='https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2013/08/02/in-jams-and-jellies-acidity-is-the-key-to-avoiding-botulism' target='_blank'>Kevin West</a>, acidity is the enemy of botulism. Foods that have a pH below 4.6, high-acid foods like apples, blueberries, strawberries (and many more) are completely safe, they have sufficient natural acidity to safeguard us against the risk of botulism. Despite this, it is still necessary to process the clean jars after filling them with jam.</p><p><b>Jam doneness</b><br><p> Apples normally have enough natural pectin to gel. Is my jam ready to take off the heat? There are three methods:</p><p><b>Temperature Test:</b> Take the temperature of the jelly with a candy or jelly thermometer. When done, the temperature of the jelly should be 100°C if you are at sea level. NOTE: For each 305 m of altitude above sea level, subtract 2 degrees. For instance, at 305 m of altitude, the jelly is done at 100°C; at 610 m, 102°C, etc<p><b>Spoon or Sheet Test</b>. Dip a cool metal spoon into the boiling jelly mixture and lift the spoon out of the steam so the syrup runs off the side. When the mixture first starts to boil, the drops will be light and syrupy. As the syrup continues to boil, the drops will become heavier and will drop off the spoon two at a time. When the two drops form together and sheet off the spoon, the jellying point has been reached.</p><p><b>Refrigerator/Freezer Test</b>. Pour a small amount of boiling jelly on a plate, and put it in the freezing compartment of a refrigerator for a few minutes. If the mixture gels, it should be done. During this test, the rest of the jelly mixture should be removed from the heat <a href='https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_07/jelly_point.html' target='_blank'>[ref]</a>.</p><p><b>Sugar.</b> Adding too little sugar may cause the jam to ferment. In this recipe, we added demerara sugar (it's what we had on hand) so this why the jam is dark. We like it because it has plenty of molasses in it, lending the jam a deep and pleasant toffee-esque flavor. Feel free to use other varieties of sugar, especially if you prefer a lighter-colored jam, or if you don't like the flavor of molasses.</p><p><b>Recommended Process Time</b></p><p>When processing jars in a boiler canner, the time varies depending on the altitude where you live. For this recipe (hot pack) the recommended time for those living from  0 - 305 m (0 - 1,000 ft) is 10 minutes, but the <a href='https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_07/apple_preserves.html' target='_blank'>National Center for Food Preservation</a> recommends 5 minutes, I do the longer time to avoid having to pre-boil the jars. For 305 m - 1829 m (1,001 - 6,000 ft) the time is 10 minutes, and 15 minutes for anyone above 1829 m (6,000 ft).</p><p><b>Sterilizing Empty Jars</b></p><p>It is unnecessary to presterilize jars for fruits, tomatoes, and pickled or fermented foods that will be processed 10 minutes or longer in a boiling-water canner.</div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/chunky_apple_jam.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/quick_flat_bread.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>A quick no-yeast flat bread recipe, ideal when you want bread but don't want to wait. The flat bread is ready in under 45 minutes (includes resting time), and it's possible to prepare under 15 minutes—we do this a lot—if necessary (without the resting time).</p><p>Allowing the dough to relax after kneading makes it easier to work with, but if you skip that step it's still possible to roll it out, it'll just be a bit harder to do.</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions:</b></p><p><b>Flour:</b> Switching whole wheat flour for spelt, or all-purpose won't affect the dough.</p><p><b>Fat:</b> Fat is necessary in this recipe, it helps to create a smooth, rich and pliable dough. Using other types of oil, like canola or sunflower oil, is fine. It's possible to use vegan butter, but it's important to soften and mix it in with other liquids first. If using vegan butter, measure out 50 g.</p><p><b>Liquid:</b> For an even richer, and even MORE pliable dough, substitute water for plant milk. I recommend using soy, as it is richer than rice or oat milk. On the boat, we tend not to use milk because we rarely keep any (lacking a fridge).</p><p><b>Add-ins:</b> We sometimes like to add seeds, like sesame, flax or sunflower, to my breads. Add the seeds after adding water, folding them into the dough.</p><p><b>Sourdough discard:</b> to make this recipe with <a href='sourdough_starter.html'>sourdough discard</a>, measure 190 g (1 1/4 cups) of whole wheat flour and 113 g (1/2 cup) of the discard. You'll have to reduce the water, depending on the hydration level of your starter. We only added 130 ml of water instead of the full 180 ml. The sourdough won't provide much leavening or taste, this is just a way to add extra nutrition and to use discard.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/quick_flat_bread.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

Optionally, you can add roasted green peppers and other vegetables to further augment the flavor and nutrition of the dip.</p><p><b>Add-ins: </b> Add 20 g (~1/2 cup) of chopped parsley and/or 2 diced tomatoes for extra texture and flavor. For a more complex (and sweet) taste, add 45 ml (~3 tbsp) of pomegranate molasses. You can also use grape molasses.</p><p><b>Garlic: </b> The garlic doesn't need to be roasted, you can use it fresh. If you do this, you will have to use ~4-5 cloves instead of the whole head. Use a mortar and pestle to crush the peeled garlic into a paste before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/roasted_eggplant_dip.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Banana ice cream is a simple alternative to dairy or coconut based desserts. It's a no-fuss recipe that requires little preparation and waiting time.</p><p>Making it is easy, and only requires putting bananas in the freezer. While waiting for them to harden up, prepare your balsamic coulis. If you've ever boiled balsamic vinegar, you know that it can sting your eyes. Making a balsamic vinegar reduction makes it thick and syrupy, and works well as a topping. We like the contrast of the bananas and vinegar.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/balsamic_banana_ice_cream.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>We like making syrups, or juice reductions a lot. It's simple, and you can use it in many other recipes afterwards. Reductions that aren't sweetened with sugar are great as an add-on to sauces, or when used alone as a 'glaze'.</p><p>We used a technique by the cook <a href='https://discoginferno.wordpress.com/tag/sesame-seed-syrup' target='_blank'>Mike Case</a>, he made a white sesame syrup to use in cocktails. We liked not requiring a blender to make it, blending sesame seeds into a smooth liquid is tough, my immersion blender can't grind seeds finely. Boiling the seeds, and then straining them out is simple, and since you can re-use the seeds afterwards, there's no waste. Toasting the seeds beforehand helps to bring out the nutty flavor, so don't skip that step.</p><p>This syrup pairs well with ice cream, especially those with subtle flavors like coconut and vanilla. It's delicious on fruit ice cream too. To make fruit ice cream, slice fruit of choice thinly. Lay a sheet of parchment paper over a plate, and lay your fruit overtop (this will keep the fruit from sticking). Let them freeze for a few hours, then run them through an immersion blender. You can use almost any fruit to make it, but it works especially well for <a href='mango.html'>mango</a> and <a href='bananas.html'>bananas</a>.</p><p>You can use the left-over seeds to bake into desserts, or to add as an extra topping.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/black_sesame_syrup.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/breaded_chickpea_tofu_fingers.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>Was in the mood for some baked veggie fingers, didn't have tofu, but what we did have was a jar full of chickpea flour. Burmese tofu is made with chickpea flour, one of our staple foods. We first learned about this kind of tofu by reading The Burmese Kitchen by Aung Thein. The process for making this kind of tofu is usually much longer, if you're interested in making it the correct way the process is described at length on <a href='https://www.netcooks.com/recipes/Salads/Burmese-Style.Tofu.html' target='_blank'>this page</a>(which was copied digitally from The Burmese Kitchen). Our recipe suggests a quick way to make chickpea tofu, which was inspired by <a href='https://www.veganricha.com/chickpea-flour-tofu/#recipe' target='_blank'>this recipe</a>. We prepared a batch of spicy, green scallion 'chickpea tofu' and coated it with breadcrumbs.</p><p>The lemon juice adds flavor to the crumbs, no need for eggs or flour.</p><p>We served these with sambal oelek, it's spicy but works well with the dish. We've been pairing this condiment with a lot of foods lately, we are sure these would also be good with a sweet mustard dip</p><p>Left-over breading will keep for weeks if stored in an airtight container.</p><p><b>Besan flour</b>. In this recipe I use chickpea flour, ground from whole dry chickpeas(garbanzo beans), besan/gram flour comes from ground brown chickpeas(sometimes peas too) and usually comes out finer, smoother when ground into flour. If using besan(gram) flour, remove 60 ml of water, or add 1/4 cup of flour. It's also possible to make chickpea tofu by soaking the beans, to blend them and to use that to make the batter(cooked, of course).</p><p><b>Thicker chickpea tofu.</b>. If you prefer a firmer chickpea tofu, use 450 ml of vegetable broth instead of 500 ml.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/breaded_chickpea_tofu_fingers.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/brownies.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>To make great brownies, you need to pay a special attention to how you treat the eggs and sugar. These two ingredients need good whipping to add heft to the batter.</p><p>How do you know you've got the whipping right? If you lift your whisk after mixing, the eggs will dribble in thick ribbons which hold their shape on top of the batter for a few seconds. This is what bakers call the <b>ribbon stage</b>. This ability of eggs to swell is the basis of great pastries and desserts, for leavening they don't need baking powder or baking soda and instead rely on the air held in place by the whipped eggs.</p><p>These properties aren't unique to chicken eggs. It's possible to get good ribboning with both flax seeds and aquafaba (liquid from chickpeas), but aquafaba yields better results in baking.</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions</b></p><p><b>Fat :</b> Use 90 ml of canola oil instead of vegan butter. To make your own vegan butter, look for the recipe in <b>The Homemade Vegan Pantry by Miyoko Schinner</b>. It's possible to use less fat, but you can only substitute half the amount of fat before it affects the texture. For example, you can use 45 ml (1/8th cup) of vegetable oil (canola, sunflower) with 60 g (45 ml) of pumpkin puree.</p><p><b>Chocolate : </b>Use <a href='unsweetened_cocoa_powder.html'>unsweetened cocoa powder</a> instead of bar chocolate, for every 30 g (1 oz) of chocolate add 15 g (3 tbsp) of cocoa powder plus 15 g (1 tbsp) of vegan butter.</p><p><b>Tip : </b>To prevent burning the bottom of your brownies, place the pan on a preheated cookie sheet.

<div><p>An onigirazu is a Japanese rice ball sandwich, or a 'lazy onigiri'.</p><p>The word onigiri (or nigiru) means to press into shape using your hands, while razu means the opposite. Free form onigiri. This is perfect for people who have a hard time making rice balls. Onigirazu has the same great taste, without the fear of imperfection.</p><p>This recipe is perfect when you don't have the right type of rice available for onigiri. You can use just about any type, we tested it out a few different kinds. The seaweed wrapping will keep it together, thus eliminating the need for sticky rice.</p><p>We seasoned the rice with miso for added flavor, and filled it with carrot kinpira—'kinpira' means sauteed (usually with a mixture of mirin soy sauce and chili peppers.) It's a sweet and spicy dish that the Japanese serve in bentos.</p><p><b>Inorganic arsenic(iAs)</b>. Rice can be a significant source of iAs, especially brown rice because it is concentrated in the outer bran layer(bran is removed in white rice). Cooking the rice in excess water, say using a 1:6 rice to water ratio, reduces iAs up to 60 percent. [<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>]. How to cook the rice?<br><b>Method 1:</b> Boil 4 cups(1 cup of water for every cup of rice), add rice and boil for 5 minutes, discard the water, add 1 1/2 cups of fresh water back to the pot with the rice and bring to a boil, then lower to medium and cook until the water is absorbed.<br><b>Method 2:</b> Regardless of the kind of rice you are cooking, bring a pot-full of water to a boil, add the rice and cook it like pasta(15 minutes boiling time for basmati), then drain the water out.<br>Note that soaking rice is also a good way to reduce iAs, but cooking the rice in excess water is a better approach.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/carrot_kinpira_onigirazu.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>We have arrived in New Zealand, the land of plenty. All of the foods that we like and miss are here. Foods like nutritional yeast, miso and soba (to name a few).<p><p>With a fully re-stocked pantry, we started to make faux-cheese again, a recipe from <a href='http://www.veganricha.com/2014/08/almond-milk-pepper-jack-cheese-vegan-glutenfree-recipe.html' target='_blank'>Vegan Richa</a> that is simple to make and that we love. The recipe is for a cheese that can be cut into wedges, or that can be grated over pizza. I had an idea to use this recipe to make filling for ravioli, the difference being that we won't add any agar agar (a seaweed based powder that makes liquids gellify)</p><p>Making the ravioli is easy, and requires laying out a thin sheet of dough, and adding bits of the spinach and cheese mix into separate small mounds across. Leaving enough space between each 'mound' is necessary, as another sheet of dough is laid overtop and that the space ensures that both sheets will stick together.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/cheese_and_spinach_ravioli.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>In the last couple of years, we've removed most pre-made cleaning and hygiene products from our lives. In fact, we don't use shampoo at all anymore. We make our own toilet cleaner, kitchen cleaner, and we also make our own toothpaste.</p><p>Chances are you already have all of the ingredients at home to make it. The recipe consists of <a href='baking_soda.html'>baking soda</a>, <a href='coconut_oil.html'>coconut oil</a> and <a href='peppermint_oil.html'>peppermint oil</a> (food grade).</p><p>You can also brush your teeth with a simple baking soda and water mix (mix 1 tsp of baking soda with a small amount of water). Baking soda's relatively low abrasivity is enough to remove accumulations on teeth, and it rinses clear leaving a lightly salty taste. It's important to dilute the baking soda, as too much can be damaging. For those who dislike brushing with a salty taste, adding peppermint oil helps to smooth down both the taste and texture, although this ingredient is for taste, and it <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4606594/' target='_blank'>isn't yet known</a> if is truly effective against oral diseases.</p><p>As for the use of coconut oil, it is thought <a href='https://www.healthline.com/health/homemade-toothpaste#recipes' target='_blank'>to reduce plaque</a> after continued use. A downside to using coconut oil, is that it becomes solid in cold climates, and it's necessary to melt it down before using it. We like to put the jar near a source of heat for 5 minutes or so. Another detail to consider, is that the oil may clog your drain in cold weather. We've noticed this on our boat, and so we spit in a glass and pour it overboard.</p><p>The ingredients in homemade toothpaste vary, some add bentonite clay and other essential oils, so we opted for the simplest recipe possible. Homemade toothpaste is controversial, as recipes lack fluoride, an ingredient that reduces cavities and that addresses other oral health conditions, but we believe that toothpaste is only as good as your brushing (which should last for a min of 2 min). It is more important to brush your teeth thoroughly than to use toothpaste, especially after eating sweets. In all, we prefer to avoid packaging and make our own, it works for us and it might work for you too.</p><p><b class='head'>Abrasion properties of baking soda</b></p><p>Tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the body, but some brands of abrasive toothpaste can wear it down, exposing the dentin lying beneath. To help quantify the abrasivity of dentifrices, researchers established a standardized scale called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(dental)#Relative_dentin_abrasivity' target='_blank'>Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA)</a>. This scale assigns toothpaste an abrasivity value, relative to a standard reference abrasive that is arbitrarily given an RDA value of 100. All dentifrices at or below 2.5 times the reference value, or 250 RDA, are considered safe and effective [1]. In fact, clinical evidence supports that lifetime use of proper brushing technique with a toothbrush and toothpaste at an RDA of 250 or less produces limited wear to dentin and virtually no wear to enamel [2]. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) has a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness' target='_blank'>Mohs hardness</a> value of 2.5 and an RDA value of 7.</p><p><b class='head'>Sources</b></p><p>[1] St John S, White DJ.

<div><p>The idea of making beer bread came from a book written by Lin Pardey called "The Care and Feeding of the Offshore Crew". In this book, Lin talks about cooking at sea, and has an entire chapter dedicated to baking onboard. In this chapter, the author talks about the many ways to make fresh bread while sailing, including a quickbread recipe that uses 3 basic ingredients: flour, sugar and beer.</p><p>Beer bread you say? Right up our alley. The next day we gave it a try, the result was fantastic.</p><p>The amazing thing about beer bread is that using different beer, will change the flavor and color of the bread.

The flesh of the fruit can be kneaded with ease, especially if the fruit is very ripe. I have tried to knead it when half-ripe, it works too, but requires added moisture and more kneading, not to mention that it doesn't have as much flavor. Ripe breadfruit develops a sweet taste. It can be difficult to catch it at the right moment, like avocados they have a tendency to overripen overnight. Because we like it so much, we've bought many and have had time to better tell when it can be eaten. The outside becomes soft to the touch, but only just.</p><p>We serve these with a light sauce, to better taste the gnocchi.

<div><p>Yes, another <a href='breadfruit.html'>breadfruit</a> recipe! This fruit is one of the most versatile ingredients we've ever cooked with, it's cheap and pairs well with just about anything. When we returned to the south pacific last June, you can be sure that the first thing we went looking for at the market was this lovely green wonder. It's become a staple for us, a treat and food we are excited to cook and eat.</p><p>While in a grocery store in Fiji, we spotted breadfruit flour! A company called <b><a href='http://friendfiji.com' target='_blank'>Friend's Fiji style</a></b> sells it in bags of 300g. It's a good alternative if the fresh kind can't be found. It's something we'll stock up on when we leave, so we continue to have breadfruit in our diet (in some form).</p><p>Making pasta from scratch requires your hands, a knife and a rolling pin (or bottle, whatever works). Making pasta by hand that is even and thin is a challenge, it's easier to opt for thicker 'udon-style' noodles. Expert soba chefs in Japan can cut noodles thinly, but this requires experienced hands. We have a good blade, but lack the patience as well as the desire to cut even noodles. We're very okay with imperfect noodles.</p><p><b>Tricks for cutting pasta evenly:</b> Roll the flattened piece of dough and cutting it cross-wise is the key, the details on how to do this are in the recipe instructions below.</p><p>If you come to Fiji and like to make pasta from scratch, try and find some breadfruit flour. That same company also produces cassava flour.</p><p>We like to eat breadfruit pasta with garlic, chilis and bitter melon, sauteed in olive oil with some shredded nori on top- simple, and tasty. Alternatively, to make regular pasta, just sub the breadfruit flour for 85 g of <a href='whole_wheat_flour.html'>whole wheat flour</a> or 75 g <a href='spelt_flour.html'>spelt flour</a>.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/breadfruit_pasta.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>A recipe for the March 2021 Merveilles Cooking Jam.</p><p>Our default buckwheat recipes include <a href='buckwheat_tea.html'>Buckwheat Tea</a> and <a href='arame_soba.html'>Soba</a>. We like making soba, but it is a long, and messy process. Buckwheat is difficult to work with, especially if the aim is to make 100% soba (most are cut with wheat flour). So this recipe is a way to eat more buckwheat in our diet without defaulting to soba.</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions</b></p><p><b>Buckwheat:</b> It is possible to use pre-ground flour, I just like to grind my own because it keeps longer as groats. If buying flour, you'll notice a darker and lighter variety, using either is fine. The darker variety has the hull mixed in, and the lighter version doesn't. Hulled buckwheat has more nutrients.</p><p><b>Tomato:</b> tomato paste is a concentrate, it is useful on a boat as it helps save space (instead of carrying larger cans). When using tomato paste, use it with equal parts water. If using whole tomatoes from a can, be sure to crush the tomatoes to help release its juices, and don't add extra water. The cooking time might be longer to help reduce and thicken the liquid. Using fresh tomatoes is another obvious option. Cut, and crush them with a fork in the pan when cooking.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/buckwheat_dumplings.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

It's a type of tea that is served in some soba shops, as a companion drink to buckwheat noodles. It has a subtle nutty flavor, and is perfect to drink after dinner, or later at night as it doesn't have any caffeine.</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/buckwheat_tea_1.jpg'></p><p> We roast the groats as we need them, but it's possible to prepare a larger batch ahead of time. The roasted buckwheat groats will store for a few months if kept in a cool and dry place. </p><p><b>Roasting a larger batch:</b> When roasting a larger batch, use a larger pan so that the groats don't sit atop of each other. The groats must be in a single layer so they can cook evenly.</p><p> <b>Re-using the softened groats:</b> It's possible to re-use the softened groats by pouring more water onto them, although the flavor will not be as strong. If you like to minimize food waste, it's possible to incorporate the soft groats in other meals for bulk. For example, you can mix it into rice, cookies, breads etc.</p><p> <b>Cooking groats using oven:</b> You can roast your buckwheat groats in your oven.

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/chocolate_chip_cookies.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>We've been making chocolate chip cookies for a while, but never thought it worthy of a recipe because there are so many online already. In the interest of posting absolute basic recipes though, we felt it deserved to be written down, especially because cookie chemistry is difficult. Slight differences in moisture content, altitude, fat content and sugar content can alter the look and texture of a cookie. There are reasons for the quantities and choice of each ingredient, all interact with each other to give cookies their sweet and soft texture.</p><p>This recipe is a good base. Substitutions are possible, but changing ingredients—depending on the ingredient—can mess up your recipe. In our suggestions we give examples of good substitutions, and how to modify the recipe to get a good result.<b class='head'>Substitutions</b> <b>Flour:</b> If you choose to use spelt flour, a more nutritious alternative, add 5 ml (5 ml) of baking powder to help it rise.</p><p><b>Fat:</b> The fat in cookies is a big part of their structure. We've added vegan butter(or margarine) as it behaves like actual butter, it helps create baked goods that are more tender by shortening gluten strands. When fat coats flour, it slows down the process of gluten formation creating a more tender product <a href='https://bakerbettie.com/function-of-butter-in-baking/#The_Function_of_Butter_in_Baking'>ref</a>. To make your own vegan butter, look for the recipe in <b>The Homemade Vegan Pantry by Miyoko Schinner</b>.</p><p><b>Sugar:</b> Sugar is important in cookies, it helps with the flavor, color and texture. The oven temperature causes the sugar to react with the proteins, this is what gives baked goods their brown color. Natural brown sugar is important in this recipe, as it adds moisture to the dough. If you use 100% granulated white sugar the cookie won't spread as well, not unless you add more moisture.</p><p><b>Add-ins:</b> If you have a sensitivity to caffeine use <a href='carob_chips.html'>carob chips</a> instead of chocolate chips. Switching to carob won't affect the cookies. <b class='head'>Troubleshooting</b>"I followed the recipe, but my cookies don't look the same as yours!" The quirkiness of different ovens makes it difficult to give accurate cooking times. Having a thermometer in your oven is the best way to read the temperature accurately.</p><p><b>Help! Cookie spreading too much!</b> If your cookie is spreading too much, you may have added too much sugar. Sugar is hygroscopic, it absorbs liquid but once it bakes it releases that and if there's too much, then it keeps spreading. Oven temperature is another factor. The hotter the oven, the more quickly the fat melts before the cookies have time to set. Depending on your oven, you may need to bake cookies longer but at a lower temperature.</p><p><b>Help! Cookie not spreading!</b> One of the most common reasons why cookies don't spread is because there's too much flour in the dough. Try using less, and consider increasing the commercial brown sugar by a few tablespoons. This will add slightly more moisture and help the cookies spread. Be sure you're also using room temperature ingredients, especially butter, to promote the best spread and texture.</p><p>Read more about <a href='https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2016/03/14/cookie-chemistry-2'>cookie chemistry</a>.

<div><p>We found an old vegetarian cookbook in a book-sharing shelf. We must have spent an hour reading through it, the recipes were fantastic, the title read The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook. The cookbook had an entire section dedicated to cooking with corn. It's there that we found a recipe for masa dumplings.</p><p>Masa is corn that is simmered and ground into a paste and is the base for many recipes. You can make Mexican-style tortillas with it, that, or you can use it to make dumplings! We don't have access to fresh corn, nor do we have the space or the time to make my own masa, but we used <a href='cornmeal.html'>corn meal</a> instead and it worked! The only difference is that you need to add boiling water so you can roll the mixture into balls. If you were to use masa, you wouldn't need the added moisture.</p><p>The texture of the dumplings is fun and chewy. The outside is soft, but the inside is like that of dense cornbread.</p><p><b class='head'>Recommendations:</b></p><p>We enjoy eating it with tomato sauce or with a spicy apricot sauce. Instead of apricot jam, you can add apricot juice to the mix (orange will taste wonderful too). We added jam because I didn't have any juice on the boat, and besides, it works well in this recipe.</p><p>Adding extra spices, like cumin, chili flakes and turmeric will add a nice flavor to the dumpling mix.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/corn_dumplings.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Making crackers is simple. There are no downsides to knowing, and in a bind it's a useful skill. What's great about a basic recipe is that you can swap ingredients with little consequence (most times) and you can add to it to suit your needs and cravings.</p><p>We love to eat crackers as snacks, usually between breakfast and lunch, a cracker with some peanut butter to quiet our stomachs. We rely on crackers a lot during long passages at sea.</p><p>You can make these crackers without extras with just the 'cracker' portion of the recipe. They're just as delicious that way, but you can add seeds and spices for added flavor and nutrition. We like to add seeds to ours, like <a href='pumpkin_seeds.html'>pumpkin seeds</a>, <a href='flax_seeds.html'>flax seeds</a>, <a href='sesame_seeds.html'>sesame seeds</a>, or <a href='sunflower_seeds.html'>sunflower seeds</a>. We recommend adding <a href='black_pepper.html'>black pepper</a>, or <a href='chili_pepper_flakes.html'>chili pepper flakes</a>, these are also delicious if you sprinkle some salt over the top of them.</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions :</b></p><p><b>Oats : </b> Instead of oats processed into powder, you can use 20 g (1/4 cup) of <a href='chickpea_flour.html'>chickpea flour</a> or 30 g of <a href='buckwheat_flour.html'>buckwheat flour</a>. Sometimes we make crackers that use spelt flour.</p><p><b>Buckwheat groats reuse: </b> Whenever we brew a batch of <a href='buckwheat_tea.html'> buckwheat tea</a>, we end up with some wet groats which we use in this cracker recipe. The groats will add extra moisture to the recipe, so be careful when adding water, you'll need a lot less.</p><p><b>Oil :</b> You can use any kind of oil, but prioritize mid-neutral oils like olive (like in the recipe) or aromatic oils like sesame and chili oil. Adding sunflower oil or canola is fine, but since these crackers are very basic, adding an strongly-flavored oils will improve the taste. If you're adding plenty of spices, adding aromatic oils isn't as crucial.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/crackers.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/soy_flour_tofu.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>Over the years, we've experimented with various ways of making tofu, our favourite recipe is made from milling, and then soaking, the ground soy beans for a short time. We prefer making our own soy flour with a grain mill. It's possible to buy pre-ground flour, but make sure it isn't de-fatted.</p><p>Tofu is cheap to make. In Canada, 400g of soy beans costs about 0.35$ in bulk and makes a brick of tofu, the store bought equivalent 400g brick is 3.65$.</p><p>Making tofu from the flour is faster, there is no need to pre-soak the whole beans overnight, it also makes it easier for us to extract more milk.</p><p><b>Nigari</b> is our preferred coagulant, as it imparts less flavor than lemon juice, vinegar or epsom salt.</p><p>We got the idea to make this kind of tofu from <b>The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook</b> by Louise Hagler, and found general tofu-making tips from <b>Cooking With Tofu</b> by Yoshiko Takeuchi.</p><p>Making tofu on a boat is great, we use the hand-rail to suspend the nylon bag when pressing the milk out of the soy pulp.</p><p>It is always exciting to see the tofu curds separate from the whey.</p><p>Making tofu in a bag only is a no-fuss option. You don't need a mold to make tofu. The tofu has little bumps on it because of the perforated surface we drained it on.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/soy_flour_tofu.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Been a while since we've baked cookies. It being pumpkin season, the choice was obvious.</p><p>These are not very sweet, namely because of the addition of coconut sugar which has a subtle and more complex taste. Coconut sugar will make your cookies a darker shade of orange, almost brown, and we think it fits nicely with the toned-down color of the pumpkin seeds. If you want a bold orange color, use white cane sugar instead.</p><p><b>Leftover chocolate:</b> This recipe makes more chocolate than is needed for the recipe. If you want to keep it for later, pour it in a chocolate mold or shallow container and put it in the freezer. It will become solid and you'll have delicious homemade chocolate on the side for later times! Once it's solid, pop it out of the mold and put it in a closed container. Keep it in the freezer until you're ready to eat it!</p><p>Pumpkin puree how-to: Remove seeds and stringy flesh from pumpkin. Cut the pumpkin into large chunks and place on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven at 180 °C (350 ºF). Roast pumpkin for 45 minutes until pumpkin is soft and tender. Let cool. Remove skin, and process into a food processor or use a handstick blender. If pumpkin puree is too wet, strain liquid through cheesecloth, if too dry, add a bit of water. The puree keeps for 3 days in the fridge, and up to 3 months frozen.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/halloween_pumpkin_cookies.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Making mayo is easy. This is a basic recipe that doesn't take long to prepare, and that requires few tools.</p><p>It's possible to add other spices and ingredients to augment the flavor, like smoked paprika, garlic or fresh herbs. This recipe lends well to substitutions:</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions</b></p><p><b>Oil :</b> It's possible to use other neutral oils like sunflower oil, but we wouldn't recommend using olive oil as it will impart too much flavor.</p><p><b>Traditional mayo :</b> This recipe uses less oil than the average mayo recipe. We used soft tofu to have a thicker mixture to avoid adding extra oil, for a richer veganaise you can use soy milk or other plant milks. To do this, mix your ingredients in the order listed in the recipe (switching the tofu for 250 ml or 1 cup plant milk), then pour 350 ml to 595 ml (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups) of oil in a slow, and steady stream with the blender running. The mayo will thicken after ~4-5 minutes of blending.</p><p><b>Mustard : </b>Instead of using <a href='dijon_mustard.html'>prepared mustard</a>, you can sub with 5 g (1 tsp) of mustard powder. If you have a spice grinder or a coffee grinder, you can grind your own mustard powder from whole mustard seeds. In this recipe, we used old style <a href='dijon_mustard.html'>dijon mustard</a> with mustard seeds, which explains the texture present in the veganaise. If you want to know how to make old-style dijon mustard, check out <a href='#mustard_from_seed.html'>my recipe</a>.</p><p><b>Sweetener : </b>If you prefer sweeter venagaise, add 5 g (1 tsp) of a sweetener.</p><p><b>Vinegar :</b> Substitute lemon for apple cider vinegar, using equal amounts.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/veganaise.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/hop_ice_cream.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>We like craft beer a lot. To help satisfy our evergrowing craving, we decided to try and make hop flavored ice cream.</p><p>This ice cream is definitely for people who love the smell and taste of hops (as well as cold summer dairy-free treats).</p><p>We weren't sure how to 'infuse' the hops into the ice cream base, we tried making hop tea by infusing it overnight in the fridge, but the taste wasn't strong enough. Felt we would get better results and better flavor if the hops were heated. The pouch method worked pretty well, the ice cream base was perfect! Full of delicious bitterness! We may try making a concentrate with the hops first to mix into the base next time.</p><p>The hops used in this recipe are an American variety called "Colombus". We got them from <a href='http://www.choppeabarrock.com' target='_blank'>La Choppe a Barrock</a> on Villeneuve and Coloniale in Montreal. Every time we make home brews, we pick up the ingredients there! You can buy a wide variety of hop buds there, you can even get the pellet kind.</p><p>It was our second time using an ice cream maker, we got it for free. It looks like a little red pail—super cute. The woman I got it from even had the manual! You can make ice cream without a machine, although having one helps with the churning process. It saves a lot of time and effort. If we hadn't gotten that ice cream maker for free, we don't think we'd have one now, but since it's here might as well use it!</p><p>If you too, are having too many beers these days, try and cook with hops instead. Same taste, different format!</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/hop_ice_cream.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

It's a Japanese roasted tea that is often served with sweet and savory dishes. It's a good low-caffeine alternative to most teas, and adds just the right amount of flavor to oatmeal without overpowering it.</p><p><b class='head'>Suggestions</b></p><p>If your nut milk is sweetened, you may not need an added sweetener. It's also possible to use a tea strainer instead of a cloth bag by putting the loose leaves in it, and letting it sit in a shallow pan.

Take note that adding red cabbage instead of green will alter the colour of the dish. Cooking the lentils with water instead of vegetable broth is possible, the spices add enough flavor. I also sometimes add konbu dashi as a more neutral base.</p><p>For a more complex taste, add cardamom, fenugreek seeds and cinnamon.</p><p>Only use shelled lentils, as whole lentils take longer to cook and the vegetables will soften too much.

If you have a fresh supply at home, that is perfect, otherwise store-bought stalks are fine. You can keep store-bought stalks longer if you do these simple steps: first, tear off any wilted leaves, wash the mint gently, and then put the stalks in a glass with a bit of water and a bag over the top.

<div><p>We always try our hardest to buy as few packaged foods as we can, and if we do buy pre-made goods we aim for glass, this too through isn't always possible.</p><p>We ran out of mustard the other day, and couldn't find any at the store that wasn't packaged in plastic. We decided then that it was better to make our own. It requires few ingredients, little time to prepare (25 min for prep, few days for soaking), and is inexpensive.</p><p>First, you need some mustard seeds. You can choose between yellow, brown and black seeds, the color affects the 'heat' of the mustard. A dark seed imparts more flavor than the lighter variety, and is what we used in this recipe. The seeds are then soaked in a mixture of water and <a href='apple_cider_vinegar.html'>apple cider vinegar</a>, although you can also use beer and white wine as a base. The water should be room temperature or cold, because using hot liquids denatures the enzymes that create the 'heat' in mustard.</p><p>We don't have <a href='tools.html'>tools</a> onboard that require electricity, so to grind and crush seeds and herbs we use a <b>heavy ceramic mortar and pestle</b>.</p><p>After the mustard is ground, it is stored in a glass jar at room temperature. Because of its antibacterial properties, mustard <b>does not require refrigeration</b>.</p><p>The best thing about making it yourself is that you can vary the quantities and base ingredients according to your personal preferences. If you don't like having a strong vinegar taste, you can lessen the amount of apple cider vinegar and add more water instead. You can also add spices and sweeteners. For traditional 'yellow mustard', all you need to do is add turmeric (for color) and a sweetener.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/mustard_from_seed.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p><b>No knead bread</b> is the easiest kind of artisan-style bread you can make at home, it requires little effort and absolutely no kneading what-so-ever.</p><p>This forgiving recipe allows for substitutions and additions of ingredients without altering the final texture of the bread. If you bake a whole wheat loaf, you might want to add 5 g of <a href='gluten_flour.html'>gluten flour</a> to help it rise.</p><p>The bread can be left to rise overnight. I usually mix it at around 2100, and bake it early the next morning at 0800. Unlike a lot of bread recipes, there is no second rise, and you don't need to knead or monitor it at all, because the gluten develops on its own. It's a recipe that is very hard to fail at, and you'll get good bread every time!</p><p>We sometimes add spices to the dough, like <a href='chili_pepper_flakes.html'>chili</a> and <a href='garlic.html'>garlic</a>, or we make a more hearty bread by adding <a href='pumpkin_seeds.html'>pumpkin seeds</a> or <a href='sunflower_seeds.html'>sunflower seeds</a>. Experiment with it!</p><p><b>Baking without a dutch oven</b></p><p>If you don't have a cast-iron container with a lid, you can use a baking pan with foil. This is the method I use, because I lack a good lid. While the bread doesn't have a hard top crust, the result is still great (the bottom will be tougher than the top). Coat the bread pan with <i>15 ml (1 tbsp)</i> <a href='olive_oil.html'>olive oil</a>, and sprinkle the inside of the pan with some <a href='cornmeal.html'>cornmeal</a> (enough to cover it all in a thin coat). The cornmeal will keep the dough from sticking to the pan. Bread pans don't keep their temperature as well as cast-iron cookware, so the bread will stick due to lack of heat. Oiling the pan is necessary.</p><p><b>Sourdough version</b></p><p>To make sourdough no-knead bread, replace the commercial yeast with a little less than 170 g (3/4 cup) of healthy, well-fed <a href='sourdough_starter.html'>sourdough starter</a>.

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/okonomiyaki.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p><b>Okonomiyaki</b> (meaning, 'grilled as you like it') is a Japanese dish, similar to the American omelette, but the main difference is the variation of ingredients. Typical okonomiyaki are made with eggs, and often include meat or fish. Making it without meat is simple enough, but without eggs? Back when we lived in Tokyo, our experience in cooking with plants was limited, but now we've been doing it long enough that we can think of alternatives with ease.</p><p>The key ingredient? <a href='chickpea_flour.html'>Chickpea flour</a>. We make chickpea pancakes, and <a href='scrambled_chickpea_flour.html'>scrambled chickpea flour</a> (resembles scrambled eggs) at home all the time. Chickpea flour is a staple on Pino, and works very well for okonomiyaki.</p><p><b>Nagaimo:</b> If you're in a place were nagaimo (or yamaimo) is available, we highly reccommend adding it to the dish. It makes a fluffier pancake. Although we've made okonomiyaki without nagaimo before, so if you can't find it know that it will work and be very delicious anyway. It imparts little flavor, all it does is add nutrition and texture. Nagaimo, unlike most potatoes, can be eaten raw. However, it is best to handle the nagaimo with gloves, or to soak the peeled tuber in a vinegar-water solution to neutralize irritant <b>oxalate crystals</b> found on their skin. Nagaimo are low-calorie, high in protein, and have potassium, zinc, vitamin C and more. The texture of grated nagaimo can be off-putting, it looks like a regular tuber when whole, but when grated it becomes slime, almost liquid. This sort of texture is well-liked in Japan and referred to as being 'neba neba' (slimy). This texture present in many other foods like okra and nattou. This texture makes it an ideal egg alternative, it can be used to make deserts when baking.</p><p><b>Aonori:</b> Aonori is another obscure ingredient, but again, it can be omitted, although it tastes really amazing with it. We made okonomiyaki without it when we were in Majuro, because it simply wasn't available, so we used finely cut nori instead. Obviously, this isn't a perfect substitution, because aonori is sweet and tastes nothing like nori. However, nori is still very delicious and pairs well enough with the okonomiyaki.</p><p><b class='head'>Okonomi sauce</b></p><p>In this recipe, we don't use true 'okonomi sauce'. Why? Because we don't use many pre-made sauces, we prefer to make our own. Okonomi sauce requires many ingredients, and honestly, the sauce we've made works really well in this recipe and makes a good okonomi sauce alternative.</p><p>If you want to make your own, you can mix 7g (1 1/2 tsp) <a href='#whole_can_sugar.html'>sugar</a>, 45g (3 tbsp) <b>ketchup</b> and 45g (3 tbsp) of vegan <b>worcestershire sauce</b>. If you are like us, and don't care to buy pre-made sauces but want to avoid buying both ketchup and worcestershire sauce, you can make these too:</p><p><b>Worcestershire sauce:</b> combine <a href='apple_cider_vinegar.html'>apple cider vinegar</a>, water, <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a>, <a href='#natural_brown_sugar.html'>sugar</a>, <a href='#mustard_seeds.html'>mustard powder</a>, onion powder, garlic powder, <a href='cinnamon.html'>cinnamon</a> and <a href='black_pepper.html'>black pepper</a> in pan, bring to a boil and cook for a minute, then let cool.</p><p><b>Ketchup:</b> Using some <b>fresh tomato sauce</b> may be enough, otherwise add a bit of <a href='#natural_brown_sugar.html'>sugar</a> and <a href='apple_cider_vinegar.html'>apple cider vinegar</a> to it.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/okonomiyaki.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>We arrived in the <a href='https://100r.co/site/marshall_islands.html' target='_blank'>Marshall Islands 3 weeks ago</a>. We are settled in, but one thing remains difficult for us: finding fresh produce. The vegetables in Majuro are imported from either Guam, or Hawaii by cargo ship, and because they spend much time at sea they are frozen. Freezing fresh whole vegetables is never a good idea, the vegetables rot before they make it onto the shelves. When possible, we opt for local produce. Majuro has few native fresh vegetables, but they do have some fruit and among these is <b>the pandanus fruit</b>.</p><p>Pandanus, or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandanus_tectorius' target='_blank'>Pandanus tectorius</a>, bears a fruit that look like a giant pinecone, it is made up of little wedge-like phalanges, commonly referred to as 'keys'. Each fruit has about 40-80 keys, the part of the keys that is attached to the core is soft, and a bright orange colour. In the Marshall Islands, people suck on the orange part which is sweet and tastes of cane sugar. The soft part can also be cut, and processed into juice. It is possible to make the juice yourself, this <b><a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/pandanus.html' target='_blank'>blog post</a></b> explains the process at length.</p><p>I don't have the space, nor the tools to prepare pandanus juice, but a store in Majuro sells frozen purée. This is what I used to prepare this pandanus fruit cake and the topping that goes with it. What does it taste like? It is similar to mango, sweet, but also bitter.</p><p>I bought a generous portion of frozen pandanus purée, and couldn't use most of it in the bread so we used the rest to make a topping. The chia seeds don't act as a thickener and can be omitted, but they add nutritional value to the meal.</p><p>If you ever come across some pandanus fruit, please try it! Making pandanus juice from scratch requires some muscle and serious dedication, but in places where it grows, chances are you'll also find a 'processed' version.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/pandanus_fruit_bread.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

To make things more difficult, grocery stores don’t sell them (they don’t sell fruit at all). The Polynesians don't buy fruit, they don't have to, they have plenty growing on their property. Getting our hands on a breadfruit was no simple task, on every island we would ask the locals, but again the fruit weren’t ready to pick off just yet.</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/pan_fried_breadfruit_1.jpg'/></p><p>We had breadfruit when we first arrived in Nuku Hiva, the owner of Snack Vaeki prepared some for us. The chef cooked it outside, over hot coals. The taste is hard to describe, it tastes like potato, but sweeter. We had the cooked breadfruit with some fresh coconut milk, extracted from a fresh coconut before our very eyes. Since then, we’ve been looking to cook it ourselves.</p><p>Then finally we got our chance! We bought a breadfruit at the Fare street market in Huahine. The seller at the fruit stand gave it a few knocks, and told us it was ready to eat! It was delicious with coconut milk, but we wanted to try something different. We cut the breadfruit into wedges and pan-fried it. We then served it with some button mushrooms, coated with sweetened soy sauce.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/pan_fried_breadfruit.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Before we arrived in the Marquesas, people made a point of telling us how difficult it was to find vegetables there. We heard that if we wanted tomatoes, we would need to get up at 0400 to get them at the market. We are early risers, but we lack the will to take the dinghy to shore in the dark. It's just as well, because others we met who had tried, came back empty-handed. In the Marquesas, most vegetables are brought in by supply ships, you can never be certain of what you're going to get. Potatoes, cucumbers, cabbages and eggplants we had plenty of, but vegetables like tomatoes, pumpkins, bok choy and salad greens were like rare pokemon.</p><p>We'd only ever made bruschetta topping with tomatoes, never thought of changing it for anything else. But then we thought, what looks like tomatoes? Papaya, sort of? They have a similar reddish tint, comparable texture too. Papaya is something Nuku Hiva has plenty of, and as it turns out, we prefer it over tomatoes now. Papaya is more firm and sweet, and pairs well with balsamic vinegar. We imagine it would taste great with mangoes too, it's something we may try when we get a craving again.</p><p>If something isn't available, or is too expensive where you are (hunting for raspberries in Japan comes to mind), swap it out for something else. Not every ingredient will work, but it's fun to try.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/papaya_bruschetta_topping.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

Making reductions of fruit juices is very easy, it adds a 'touch of fancy'.</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions</b></p><p><b>Fat :</b> Use 60 g (~1/4 cup) vegan butter instead of oil. If you do this, you'll have to heat the cocoa powder, butter, salt, sugar and spices in a double boiler or any small pan placed over a pot of gently simmering water. When you mix the chocolate/butter mix with the flour, beat vigorously (40-50 strokes) with a spatula so that the fat doesn't separate when baking. Alternatively, you can use coconut oil, but it will alter the base flavor of the brownies in a big way. It's better to use neutral oils, like sunflower. A final option is to use 100% vegan butter, if you want to do this add 145 g (~10 tbsp) to your recipe instead of the canola oil and pumpkin.</p><p>Final tip: To prevent burning the bottom of your brownies, place the pan on a preheated cookie sheet.

<div><p>In British Columbia, we like to walk around to pick blackberries in the summer. There are blackberry bushes everywhere. We brought a bowl with us, and filled it up in one short hour! We made a cake with the berries that same night.</p><p><b>Substitutions:</b></p><p><b>Milk:</b> Oat milk works well as a substitute.<br><b>Flour:</b> You're welcome to use all purpose flour, or a mixture cut with spelt. We used 100% whole wheat because we're trying to get used to carrying one type of flour. The cake rose well.</br><b>Oil:</b> Can substitute for any other neutral oil, like sunflower and grapeseed. The fat in this recipe was already reduced, I don't recommend using less.<br><b>Fruit:</b> This recipe works well with other berries, or fruit like banana, apples etc.</p><p><b>Haybox:</b></p><p>A haybox is a cooker that utilizes the heat of the food being cooked to complete the cooking process. Food items to be cooked are heated to boiling point, and then insulated.</p><p>After pan off the stove, we transfer it to a bin with clothing. We layer a dish cloth underneath and overtop, and then bury it with clothes, or a sleeping bag. The cast iron retains its heat well, and the layers of fabric help to retain it even further. It's a way to save fuel when cooking. We also like to use our pressure cooker to retain heat, but we can only ever do that when we use our cast iron pot (it fits inside, the pan doesn't). <b>NOTE: Although, a half recipe works better than full, because it is more difficult to heat a thicker cake all the way through</b>. As soon as we take it off the heat, we put it in the pressure cooker, add the lid and plug up the top. It stayed warm for an entire hour. In winter, these systems may not retain the heat as well, more insulation may be necessary.</p><p><b>If you prefer to bake this cake in the oven</b>, see the instructions at the bottom of the recipe.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_blackberry_cake.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>These days, I've been experimenting with baking without an oven. This limits what recipes we can make, but also gives us plenty of opportunities for learning how to do things differently.</p><p>We prepared the 'dough' on the stovetop, using a cast-iron pan. Any kind of pan will do, we just really like cast iron. The resulting texture is very moist compared to a traditional cookie, but it is very delicious and requires few tools to prepare.</p><p><b class='head'>Recipe notes:</b></p><p><b>Oats:</b> Only use quick-cooking oats, as <a href='rolled_oats.html'>rolled oats</a> or steel-cut oats will not absorb moisture as quickly, and the 'dough' won't bind. Making your own quick-oats is easy, just pop some rolled oats in a blender, or pulverize with a mortar and pestle. Don't overblend, as you'll end up with oat powder.</p><p><b>Vegan butter:</b> Vegan butter adds flavor. It's possible to substitute with coconut oil, but it will alter the flavor. To make your own vegan butter, look for the recipe in The Homemade Vegan Pantry by Miyoko Schinner. It's possible to omit the butter entirely and to double the quantity of peanut butter.</p><p><b>Cocoa powder:</b> If you have a sensitivity to caffeine use <a href='carob.html'>carob powder</a> instead. Switching to carob will alter the flavor of the cookie — in a good way.</p><p><b>Sugar:</b> You can substitute with any other kind of sugar, but if you choose to add commercial brown sugar reduce the added water content (a little).</p><p><b>Soy milk:</b> We make this recipe with just water often, but adding soy milk (or any other nut milk) makes for a richer flavor.</p><p><b>Peanut butter:</b> We like peanut butter a lot, so we add it in everything. We use 100% peanut butter. If you use a sweetened variety, you can use less sugar.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_choco_oat_cookies.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Burmese tofu is made with chickpea flour, one of our staple foods. We first learned about this kind of tofu by reading The Burmese Kitchen by Aung Thein. The process for making this kind of tofu is usually much longer, if you're interested in making it the correct way the process is described at length on <a href='https://www.netcooks.com/recipes/Salads/Burmese-Style.Tofu.html' target='_blank'>this page</a>(which was copied digitally from The Burmese Kitchen). Our recipe suggests a quick way to make chickpea tofu, which was inspired by <a href='https://www.veganricha.com/chickpea-flour-tofu/#recipe' target='_blank'>this recipe</a>. It's a great soy-free alternative, and the texture is comparable to that of soft tofu.</p><p><b>Note</b>: This recipe will use up about half of the burmese tofu, which means you'll have a whole other half to use in other meals.</p><p>We thought the chickpea tofu would be well-suited as a 'mock unagi kabayaki', and that it would look especially striking atop some black rice.</p><p>The sauce served over unagi (eel) kabayaki is sweet, with hints of caramel. Most Japanese sauces are easy to make, and usually require around 3-4 ingredients, these almost always include: soy sauce, sake, mirin, or Japanese rice vinegar. If you want to cook Japanese food, having these around is a must.</p><p><b>Besan flour</b>. In this recipe I use chickpea flour, ground from whole dry chickpeas(garbanzo beans), besan/gram flour comes from ground brown chickpeas(sometimes peas too) and usually comes out finer, smoother when ground into flour. If using besan(gram) flour, remove 60 ml of water, or add 1/4 cup of flour. It's also possible to make chickpea tofu by soaking the beans, to blend them and to use that to make the batter(cooked, of course).</p><p><b>Thicker chickpea tofu.</b>. If you prefer a firmer chickpea tofu, use 450 ml of vegetable broth instead of 500 ml.</p><p><b>Inorganic arsenic(iAs)</b>. Rice can be a significant source of iAs, especially brown rice because it is concentrated in the outer bran layer(bran is removed in white rice). Cooking the rice in excess water, say using a 1:6 rice to water ratio, reduces iAs up to 60 percent. [<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>]. How to cook the rice?<br><b>Method 1:</b> Boil 4 cups(1 cup of water for every cup of rice), add rice and boil for 5 minutes, discard the water, add 1 1/2 cups of fresh water back to the pot with the rice and bring to a boil, then lower to medium and cook until the water is absorbed.<br><b>Method 2:</b> Regardless of the kind of rice you are cooking, bring a pot-full of water to a boil, add the rice and cook it like pasta(15 minutes boiling time for basmati), then drain the water out.<br>Note that soaking rice is also a good way to reduce iAs, but cooking the rice in excess water is a better approach.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sweet_mock_eel_nigiri.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/seitan.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p><b>Seitan</b> (say-tan) or <b>wheat meat</b>, is very meat-like, it's prepared using a variation of spices and other seasonings. It is the base of Buddhist vegetarian cooking, and has been documented in China since the 6th century. It's an ingredient that is also present in Japanese cuisine, for <b>Shojin Ryori</b> (vegetarian cooking)—an important term to remember if you don't eat meat and are traveling there. Seitan takes on a different name there, it is known as <b>Fu</b>, and can be found in two forms: raw (nama-fu) or dry-baked (yaki-fu, which looks like bread).</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/seitan_2.jpg'/></p><p>Seitan, or Fu, can be produced at home, but it's very labor intensive. Making it requires kneading wheat flour with water to rinse out the starch from the wheat, what remains is a sticky mass of pure gluten protein. If your plan is to make it from scratch, good on you, but otherwise, <a href='gluten_flour.html'>gluten flour</a> (or vital wheat gluten) is your best bet. The basic ingredients for seitan are gluten flour and water, but it's best to flavor it with other ingredients as it is rather bland on its own. The amount of liquid that you use to make your dough will also affect the chewiness of your seitan, less waters means more chewy with a harder texture, and more will make it tender.</p><p>In this recipe, we added chickpea flour for added nutrition. Wheat gluten proteins are deficient in lysine (an essential amino acid for good health), adding a lysine-rich food like chickpea flour to the mix makes up for this deficiency.</p><p>When preparing seitan, it's important to flavor both the inside and outside of the dough. Adding a variation of ingredients to the dough mix such as <a href='ginger.html'>ginger</a>, <a href='garlic.html'>garlic</a>, <a href='onion_powder.html'>onion powder</a>, <a href='tomato_sauce.html'>tomato sauce</a>, <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a> and so on will make it extra flavorful, the same goes for the broth. Adding vegetable broth and <a href='soy_sauce.html'>soy sauce</a> as a base, and roughly chopped <a href='onions.html'>onions</a>, <a href='garlic.html'>garlic</a> and <a href='ginger.html'>ginger</a> will season the outside of the dough.</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/seitan_4.jpg'/></p><p>There are <b>3 ways</b> to cook seitan: <b>boiling, steaming or baking</b>. In this recipe, we used the boiling method. Steaming requires wrapping the dough in foil or some other wrapper to help it keep its shape, then steaming it in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water for 30 minutes or so. Baking the seitan, means flattening or stretching the dough to fit the baking dish, adding seasonings overtop, and baking it for an hour. All methods are good, but some are better for certain kinds of meals.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/seitan.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>We like making our own crackers, and to play around with different flavors. We enjoy the taste of the Japanese spice mix <b>Shichimi Togarashi</b>, which translates to '7-flavor chili pepper'.</p><p><b>How to make your own spice mix:</b></p><p>If you have a well-stocked spice rack, you can easily make it yourself. Mix together: 30 g chili flakes, 15 g sanshou (sichuan peppercorns), 15 g <a href='dried_orange_peel.html'>dried orange peel</a>, 5 g <a href='black_sesame_seeds.html'>black sesame seeds</a>, 5 g <a href='white_sesame_seeds.html'>white sesame seeds</a>, 10 g ground ginger and 10 g <a href='aonori.html'>aonori</a>.</p><p>Some people substitute sichuan peppercorns for black peppercorns, we don't reccommend doing that, as they're not interchangeable, sichuan peppercorns are what makes it taste awesome. It's a numbing pepper, with a really distinctive taste and aroma. If you eat one peppercorn, you'll notice right away that it numbs your tongue and alters your sense of taste.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/shichimi_togarashi_crackers.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>If someone was to ask us which food we could eat forever without stopping, we'd answer chickpeas. There's a TON of different ways to prepare them, and all of these ways are delicious. Chickpeas are delicious when baked, squished, pureed, ground and sprouted. Their versatility make our lives easier, we can eat them everyday and it doesn't ever get boring.</p><p><b>Nutrition</b>: Legumes is an important part of the diet, and one of the best plant sources of <b>lysine</b>, one of 9 essential amino acids required for good health. Protein is necessary for muscles, bones, hormones, digestive enzymes, to absorb nutrients and to rebuild cells. If you eat 1/2 cup dry beans a day, your daily protein needs are covered.</p><p>Another plus is that dry chickpeas keep a long, long time. If you keep them in air-tight containers they will last even longer, because moisture and oxygen is the enemy of all beans. Oxygen makes the bean oils rancid overtime. You can store them for 5+ yrs if you add oxygen absorbers (packet consisting of powdered iron oxide) to the containers. We like to buy them in bulk and cook them as needed. An advantage of buying them dry is that it is cheap, and they taste better (honest).

<div><p>Making popcorn on the stovetop is not a recipe perse, it's a reminder that it's easy to do and that it doesn't require any specialized tools or ingredients. It doesn't require a microwave, just a pot and source of heat (stove).</p><p>When Rek was a kid their family used Jiffy Pop, unpopped kernels, oil, and flavoring agents that come in a heavy-gauge aluminum foil pan. Rek enjoyed seeing the foil rise up into a dome as the kernels started to pop. Then later, their family adopted microwavable bags. These products—while easy and fun—cost more and create unnecessary waste. Because we grew up with packaged popcorn, the idea of trying to pop our own kernels only occurred to us MUCH later in life.</p><p>So, again, this is a reminder that there are conveniences in life that we just don't need.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_popcorn.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>In our galley we have a few recipes that we consider staples, that we're always in the mood to eat. We usually rotate these throughout the week, adding maybe a new recipe or two to change things up. This sweet and sour lentils recipe is one of our favorites.</p><p>You can eat the lentils as is, or scoop it up with crackers. We enjoy eating it wrapped in salad or cabbage leaves.</p><p>We've cooked sweet and sour lentils often on long passages, it's a simple one-pot meal. It's also our go-to recipe during pot lucks—even people who don't like lentils will enjoy it (we've never had any complaints).</p><p><b class='head'>Substitutions</b></p><p>It's a versatile recipe, so if we don't have any carrots or daikon we'll sometimes put brocoli or fresh green peas instead. For a heartier meal, adding sweet potatoes is also delicious. Sometimes, if we're out of peanut butter, we'll use sesame paste instead, the flavor is very similar and doesn't change much in the recipe (also nice for those with peanut allergies). This recipe only works with whole lentils, because there's still a bite to them, halved lentils will soften too much and the resulting texture won't be as pleasant.</p><p>Enjoy this humble, but delicious recipe.</p><p><b class='head'>Sprouted lentils</b></p><p>If you use sprouted lentils, the cooking time is reduced by more than half. It can help you save on both time, and fuel, while making the lentils more digestible. For sprouting techniques, refer to <a href='sprouting.html#garbanzo'>lentils</a> in the sprouting guide.</p><p>The directions for the recipes will differ a bit. For this version of the recipe, cut the vegetables real small (tiny cubes) so they cook fast, then brown them in a pan with oil. When the veggies are done, add the sprouted lentils, and cook the mixture for 2-3 min. Finally, add the sauce, mixing well and cooking the mixture for another minute or so to allow the sauce to thicken. Top with some chives.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sweet_and_sour_lentils.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/golden_bread.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>In Quebec we call french toast 'pain doré', which translates to 'golden bread'. A fitting name. Pain doré is best made with older, and softer bread. Rek's family recipe differs in the way that it requires dairy and eggs. Substituting eggs in recipes is never easy, but not impossible. We've tried many alternatives over the years and finally ended up using chickpea flour. It's an ingredient we already use in many recipes to mimic eggs, like in <a href='okonomiyaki.html'>okonomiyaki</a> and <a href='scrambled_chickpea_flour.html'>scrambled chickpea flour</a>. When heated, chickpea flour thickens and crisps up while keeping its yellow color. We don't recommend using bananas as an egg replacer in this recipe. It's what we used to do, but it imparts too much flavor and makes it too sweet.</p><p><b>Oven version :</b> Preheat oven at 180°C. Grease a baking dish, add sliced bread and pour the left-over milk mixture overtop. Cook until golden.</p><p><b>Bread :</b> In this recipe I used some spelt sandwich bread.</p><p><b>Milk : </b> Adding vinegar to plant milk makes it curdle and taste sour, it's a simple trick used to make dairy-free buttermilk. In recipes, buttermilk adds sharpness and flavor. You're welcome to use other types of plant milk, but some varieties (like rice milk) won't curdle as well.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/golden_bread.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/sourdough_starter.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>Sourdough bread has been around for a long time. People are still making it today, even with the existence of baker's yeast.</p><p>The fermentation required to prepare it improves the flavor of the dough, and makes it easier for the body to absorb the <a href='nutrition.html#zinc'>dietary minerals</a> present in the grains.</p><p>Making sourdough bread begins with a sourdough starter. The starter is a fermenting mixture of flour and water containing microorganisms which include wild yeast and lactobacilli. The yeast produces carbon dioxide which leavens the dough, and the lactobacilli produce lactic acid which contribute flavor. The process is simple, it requires more waiting than active cooking time. We've made a summary of common questions and concerns when it comes to making a starter.</p><p><b><a id='discard'>WHY DISCARD?</a></b></p><p>Discarding starter is necessary as it quickly builds up in a jar and becomes difficult to manage. The discard works well in a variety of baked goods.</p><p><b>ADAPTING YEAST RECIPES</b></p><p>There are some key aspects to converting yeast recipes to sourdough, like hydration level and yeast. <a href='https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/sourdough/hydration-sourdough-starter/' target='_blank'>Hydration level</a> is the ratio of water to flour in a starter. You can maintain or adjust the hydration level with each feeding based on the ratio of water to flour you feed your starter. Aiming for 100% hydration, or equal weights of flour and water, is recommended.</p><p>To calculate how much added yeast is necessary, first you have to know that the rising power of 7 g of yeast (1 packet) is roughly equivalent to 226 g (1 cup) of sourdough starter.</p><p>With this information it's easy to approximate the amount of added water, flour and yeast in a recipe.</p><p><b>FEEDINGS</b></p><p>The starter needs feedings at <b>12 h intervals daily</b> in the first week, and <b>once a day afterwards</b>. As long as this starter culture is fed flour and water regularly it will remain active.</p><p><b>I forgot to feed my starter!</b> Forgetting to feed the starter isn't a big deal, feed it as soon as you remember. Feedings of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem.<br /><b>Did i feed my starter too much?</b> Feeding the wrong amount won't kill it, but it may make it appear too dry or too wet and may not rise as expected. You can correct the feeding by adding either more flour or water, it will right itself.<br /><b>Liquid on top of my starter?</b> This liquid is the alcohol given off as the wild yeast ferments. This doesn't mean it's going bad, it indicates that your starter is hungry.</p><p><b>FLOUR</b></p><p>Using wholemeal instead of processed flour for your starter is a good idea because it provides a variety of organisms and minerals.</p><p><b>FILTERED WATER</b></p><p>Using filtered (carbon filter) or distilled water instead of plain tap ensures good fermentation, as sourdough relies on microorganisms that chlorine inhibits. Leaving tap water uncovered for 24 h will allow the chlorine to dissipate.</p><p><b>Can my starter go bad?</b> Starters require more attention on the initial 6-10 days it takes to create a healthy mature starter. It hasn't yet developed defenses that characterize a mature starter. Mature starter cultures are stable because of their pH level and the presence of antibacterial agents, this helps prevent colonization by unwanted yeasts and bacteria. Sourdough breads keep fresh longer than regular bread for this reason too. The ideal temperature for starters is 21 °C, but a bit higher and lower won't hurt it. Yeast dies at 60 °C. If you see an pink or orange streak on your starter, this is a sure sign it's gone bad, discard and start over.</p><p><b>Smaller starter?</b> Because I don't bake often and that I don't want too much discard, I keep a very small batch of sourdough: 20g (4 tsp) water to 20g (2 tbsp) flour. The only downside is that it takes a lot longer to build enough starter to bake with.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sourdough_starter.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>While in Japan, we didn't have access to chickpeas and so we started to make hummus with soybeans. The result is amazing, and both of us now prefer this version. Soybeans have a rich, creamy texture, and a neutral flavor.</p><p><b class='head'>Recommendations:</b></p><p><b>Acid:</b> We sometimes add lime, or apple cider vinegar if we don't have access to lemon. Doing this doesn't alter the flavor.</p><p><b>Soybeans</b>: It is possible to make hummus with any bean, but the taste and texture will differ. We have a preference for chickpeas and red lentils. If using chickpeas, if you want a very smooth hummus take the skins off prior to blending.</p><p><b>Miso:</b> We used a miso (米こうじみそ) that is characterized by the mellow sweetness of the rice. Using a darker variety would overwhelm the dish. If sensitive to soy, try and find chickpea miso.</p><p><b>Toppings:</b> Jalapeno peppers add kick, it makes this dish rather spicy and can be omitted. If you're not a fan of spicy, try adding roasted red peppers instead.</p><p><b>Garlic:</b> We like to put raw nira (Japanese garlic chives) as a topping, or instead of garlic.

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/bean_chili.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>A hearty, warm dish. The above photo is the day-after portion.</p><p>When making chili, we swap vegetables in and out depending on what we have. For instance, we might add only carrots, or two parsnips, or potatoes. Parnips, like carrots, are cheap and plentiful in winter. Celery is common in chili recipes, but we omit it because Devine isn't a fan.<p><p><b>Beans</b>. For beans, we try and use black beans as the bulk of the recipe, but we like to add chickpeas. Chickpeas in chili is not common, but it's a legume that we always have on hand and that we both love (we don't keep pinto, or kidney beans). Swapping chickpeas for lentils would also be delicious.</p><p><b>Canned beans?</b> It is possible to use canned beans, but buying dry beans is cheaper, and means less weight on the boat. For those who insist on using cans, <b>1 drained 425 g (15 oz) can of chickpeas</b> and <b>1 drained 425 g (15 oz) cans of black beans</b> is fine for this recipe.</p><p><b>Beer?</b> Beer provides a great flavorful medium for the beans and vegetables to simmer in, it adds depth of flavor. Dark, stouts and amber beer lend well to chili. You can omit the broth or beer and exchange for <b>350 ml</b> of extra tomatoes and their juices.</p><p><b>Chile powder</b>. This is different than chili powder. Chile powder refers to pure dried, crushed (and sometimes smoked) chipotle, habanero, ancho, guajillo, piri piri, kashmiri, etc. There are no other added ingredients. To make your own, see <a href='chile_powder.html'>this recipe</a>.</p><p><b>Cocoa powder</b>. Adding cocoa powder is a trick we learned from making Japanese curry roux. Japanese cooks like to add chocolate. It pairs well with chili. Like beer, it adds depth to the dish.</a>.</p><p><b>Pressure cooker</b>. We use our pressure cooker to prepare our chili because it helps us save on fuel (our boat uses LPG), and because we prepare beans from dry. Adjust cooking times for your altitude.</p><p><b>Fresh tomatoes</b>. If you have plenty of chopped fresh tomatoes available, or if you can your own, you can use <b>800 g</b> (roughly 10 to 12 whole, although it depends on the kind of tomato, e.g., cherry vs roma) of chopped fresh tomatoes instead of a can.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/bean_chili.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

It takes less than 5 minutes to mix all the ingredients together, requiring no special tools.</p><p>The result is a thick, spreadable, and cheese-like mixture.</p><p><b>Substitutions</b></p><p><b>Plant milk</b>: If you don't like soy milk, any non-dairy milk will do. We'd recommend non-sweetened varieties or the taste may come through too much.</p><p><b>Miso</b>: We always have miso on the boat, and we use whatever kind we happen to have. We've made the mixture with white and red miso. The red miso has a stronger, deeper taste.</p><p><b>Nutritional yeast</b>: It is possible to omit the nutritional yeast, the 'cheese' will taste fine without it because of the presence of the miso, tahini and dijon mustard. If this ingredient is omitted, add less liquid so that the mixture remains thick.</p><p><b>Olive oil</b>: We use olive oil to toast the sandwhiches in a pan, but it is possible to use vegan butter, and to pre-butter the bread prior to putting it in the pan. It is possible to dry-toast the sandwhiches in pan without added oil or vegan butter, but it may take longer to brown.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/quick_grilled_cheese.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>A simple dish that we prepare in the winter time a lot. The sauce we prepare on the boat is very chunky, because we use a small hand-operated grinder(see <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/tools.html#food-chopper' target='_blank'>our model</a>) to process our beets. We only ever run the beets though the grinder once, and the texture, we think, works well enough for a sauce. For those with blenders, it is possible to puree the sauce (if a smooth texture is preferred), but it is not necessary and tastes great as is.</p><p>We love how the sauce colors the pasta.</p><p><b>Oven-roasted beets</b> It is also possible to oven-roast the beets for a deeper and more complex flavor. To roast the beets, preheat oven to <u>200 °C (400 °F)</u>. Toss the beet cubes with <i>5 ml (1 tsp)</i> of <a href='olive_oil.html'>olive oil</a>,<i>3 minced cloves</i> of <a href='garlic.html'>garlic</a>, <i>2.5 g (1/2 tsp)</i> of <a href='thyme.html'>dried thyme</a>, <i>1.25 g (1/4 tsp)</i> of <a href='salt.html'>salt</a> and some <a href='black_pepper.html'>black pepper</a>. Put chopped <a href='red_beets.html'>red beets</a> on a baking sheet and roast for <u>30 minutes</u>. Puree into a sauce and continue with the below recipe. Omit thyme and the garlic in the sauce in the below recipe, since it is already mixed with the beets in this version.</p><p><b>Golden beets?</b> It's possible to use golden beets, their flavor profile isn't too different, but they taste a bit sweeter and won't color your noodles or any other ingredient you choose to add into the recipe.</p><p><b>Garlic powder?</b> If using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, add it the pan along with the pureed beets. Note that 1/8th of a teaspoon of garlic powder equals one fresh garlic clove.</p><p><b>Fresh thyme?</b> If using fresh thyme, add it to the pureed beets, stems and all, but don't forget to remove the stem before serving or blending (if a smooth sauce is desired). Thyme sprigs are a choking hazard.</p><p><b>Milk alternatives.</b> I always have unsweetened soy milk on hand so I use that, it is possible to use unsweetened oat milk, or some full-fat coconut milk (for a richer texture).</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/beet_sauce_pasta.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>We made homemade gyoza skins with some friends a few weeks back, it's fun, but it takes a long time (it is why doing it in a group makes a lot of sense). Devine had the amazing idea of using our pasta maker to make the dough.</p><p>We didn't have any round cookie cutters to make large circles, we tried to use the bottom of a drinking glass but the rims aren't sharp and smoosh up the dough down instead. Again, Devine had a stroke of genius: Cans! We used an empty bean can, which happened to be the approximate diameter of a gyoza wrapper.</p><p>A pasta maker is not necessary to make gyoza skins, it's possible to do it with a rolling pin but it is important to get the dough thin enough. It is possible to buy pre-made gyoza wrappers, select grocery stores have them.</p><p>The gyoza wrapper techniques and ratios were based on a recipe from <a href='http://www.justonecookbook.com/recipes/gyoza-wrappers/' target='_blank'>Just one cookbook</a>.</p><p><b>Bamboo charcoal</b>. That day we used bamboo charcoal powder to color the gyoza wrappers black, but it is completely optional. If you want to do this, add <b>5 g</b> of bamboo charcoal powder(food grade) to the dry dough.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/gyoza_wrappers.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>When we visit our parents out east during the holiday season, we like to prepare millet tourtières(millet pot pies). It is a recipe we like but that we can't prepare aboard Pino because we don't have a working oven (no way to bake the tourtière). This year, we got the idea of making Japanese-style dumplings(gyoza) but with the pot pie filling we use for tourtière. We can prepare this meal on the stovetop and it tastes amazing!</p><p>For this recipe we used pre-made dumpling wrappers, but it's possible to make the wrappers yourself: see our <a href='gyoza_wrappers.html'>gyoza wrappers recipe</a>.</p><p>The tourtière filling was based on a recipe by <a href='https://www.lacuisinedejeanphilippe.com/recipe/tourtiere-de-millet-2/' target='_blank'>Jean-Philippe</a>. A tourtière recipe that we love and make every year.</p><p><b>Cutting food small</b>. An important note for this recipe is that all vegetables need to be cut very small so they fit inside a wrapper, if cut too big you'll end up with a bunch of lumpy dumplings, or dumplings that won't close. We minced the potatoes, carrots and onions for this reason (it also means they cook down faster!).</p><p><b>Dipping sauce</b>. Typically, in Quebec, millet tourtière is served with ketchup, but we decided to make a traditional gyoza dip instead and added a hint of tomato.</p><p><b>Millet</b>. Note that I used hulled millet in this recipe, toasting the grains before boiling then enhances their flavor and makes for better texture. Millet requires a water to grain ratio of 2:1. In this recipe the millet is cooked with less liquid because it will absorb more when it is cooked again in later steps.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/millet_dumplings.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/vegetable_curry.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>This recipe is a mixture between two things, Japanese kare(カレー) a milder and more basic version of Indian-style curry, and a poutine roux—ca parait qu'on est Québécois, right?</p><p>We make both Japanese kare and poutine at home, and eventually these two recipes became one because we liked it that way. </p><p>To make your own curry powder see <a href='curry_powder.html'>this page</a>, and to make your own garam masala mix see <a href='garam_masala.html'>this page</a>.</p><p><b>Sweetener</b>. Grated apple, or pear, adds a subtly sweet tone to the dish, balancing the hot and strong spice flavors. It is possible to omit the fruit and to add a bit of sugar instead.</p><p><b>Rice</b>. We usually alternate between basmati rice and short grain white rice(sushi rice). Both work well for this recipe. Note that short grain white rice uses a water to rice ratio of 1.25:1, but preboiling rice for 5 minutes in a 4:1 water to rice ratio and then discarding the water is best for reducing potential arsenic contamination[<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>].</p><p><b>Roux</b>. In this recipe we make a quick roux, a proper roux requires constant stirring and a longer cooking time. Keep in mind, the longer a roux is cooked the less thickening power it has, although the deeper the flavor of the roux will be (not important in this case because the roux is primarily a thickener). If you want roux with a deeper flavor, cook it for 15-20 minutes, or until it develops a dark chocolate color(keep in mind that you have to keep stirring the whole time). It's important to remember that <b>roux requires equal parts fat and flour (weight, not volume)</b>.</p><p><b>Cutting root vegetables small</b> We generally cut our root vegetables thin and small so they don't take too long to cook, it is especially important for us when relying on LPG to cook in the summer.</p><p><b>Inorganic arsenic(iAs)</b>. Rice can be a significant source of iAs, especially brown rice because it is concentrated in the outer bran layer(bran is removed in white rice). Cooking the rice in excess water, say using a 1:6 rice to water ratio, reduces iAs up to 60 percent. [<a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368728' target='_blank'>Source</a>]. How to cook the rice?<br><b>Method 1:</b> Boil 4 cups(1 cup of water for every cup of rice), add rice and boil for 5 minutes, discard the water, add 1 1/2 cups of fresh water back to the pot with the rice and bring to a boil, then lower to medium and cook until the water is absorbed.<br><b>Method 2:</b> Regardless of the kind of rice you are cooking, bring a pot-full of water to a boil, add the rice and cook it like pasta(15 minutes boiling time for basmati), then drain the water out.<br>Note that soaking rice is also a good way to reduce iAs, but cooking the rice in excess water is a better approach.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/vegetable_curry.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src='https://grimgrains.com/media/recipes/chocolate_turtles.jpg' width='600'/>
<div><p>Rek's dad has always been a huge fan of the Nestle chocolate turtles. We made some for him many years ago for Christmas, he really loved it, and we decided to make some again this year to serve as a dessert for a family dinner composed mainly of non-vegans. We wanted to serve a dessert that anyone could enjoy, and that didn't use any cryptic, hard-to-find, ingredients often present in vegan desserts.</p><p>There are many recipes for vegan chocolate turtles out there, but since ours has a few variations we figured we would include it. I was curious and began to research the first mention of turtles made with dates, the oldest online entry I have found so far is <a href='https://forum.vegtalk.org/t/chocolate-pecan-turtles/2534' target='_blank'>this one</a>(2010). This doesn't mean the author was the first to think of it, but they certainly deserve some credit.</p><p><b>Dates</b>. In this recipe, we used deglet noor dates because they are good and inexpensive, but it's possible to use other varieties. If the dates are larger, refer to the weight listed in the recipe, not the number of dates. The dates sold in stores may already be pitted, if they are pitted they will weigh a little less.</p><p><b>Peanuts</b>. Use unsalted varieties. The peanuts sold in stores may or may not be pre-roasted, if not, it is possible to roast them yourself in the oven. Shelled peanuts: roast at 180°C (350°F) for 15 to 20 minutes. In shell peanunts: roast at 180°C (350°F) for 20 to 25 minutes. We used peanuts because Rek has a tree-nut allergy, it is possible to use any kind of nut, anything that will help form the head and legs of a turtle.</p><p><b>Tahini</b>. The tahini is optional, but it adds a nice flavor to the dates.</p><p><b>Coconut oil</b>. Adding coconut oil to the chocolate is optional, but it adds shine to the chocolate and makes it harden more readily.</p><p><b>Leftover chocolate?</b> Pour it over another piece of parchment paper, sprinkle dried fruit over it(press each fruit down into the chocolate) and then sprinkle some coarse sea salt overtop. Let the chocolate cool, and then break off pieces to eat it!</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/chocolate_turtles.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>We like to prepare pancakes aboard Pino, especially when we run out of bread for our morning peanut butter toast ritual. Like bread and cookies, there are several key rules to making good pancakes. In the following notes we have tried to outline these rules as clearly and as thoroughly possible.</p><p><b>Baking powder</b>. If you want to double the recipe, keep in mind that the baking powder to flour ratio is 5-6.25 g (1 tsp to 1 1/4 tsp) baking powder for every 125 g (1 cup) of flour. The leavening power of baking powder can weaken overtime. To test that the baking powder is still good, drop a teaspoonful into a cup of hot water, if bubbles are visible right away it's still good, if not, replace the baking powder.</p><p><b>Wheat Berries</b>. We have a grain mill onboard and grind our own red wheat berries to make flour. Freshly-ground flour tastes better, fresher. If you buy whole wheat flour from the store keep in mind that it will oxidize quicker than white flour because whole wheat flours still have the bran and germ.<p><b>All-purpose flour</b>. If you're not comfortable using whole wheat flours, it's possible to use all-purpose flour but when mixing in the liquids be careful not to overmix. Mixing helps develop elastic gluten to help pancakes rise, but when baking soda or baking powder is used for leavening, overmixing makes the gluten so thick that air bubbles can't expand, resulting in a tough chewy pancake. If you are new to using whole wheat flour work your way up slowly, gradually replacing more and more of the all-purpose ﬂour with whole grain ﬂour.</p><p><img src='../media/recipes/whole_wheat_pancakes2.jpg'/> The above photo shows pancakes made with 50&#37; all-purpose flour and 50&#37; whole wheat. </p><p><b>Orange juice</b>. For those not used to the taste of whole wheat, replace 30-45ml (2-3 tbsp) of the liquid in the recipe with orange juice. The citrus helps to temper the ﬂavor of whole wheat (a recommendation by P.J. Hamel of King Arthur Flour).</p><p><b>Vanilla extract</b>. While optional, vanilla extract can lend a good flavor to pancakes, see <a href='https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2019/06/25/how-to-make-vanilla-extract'>how to make your own</a>.</p><p><b>Baking powder & baking soda</b>. When a recipe contains baking powder and baking soda, the baking powder does most of the leavening. The baking soda is added to neutralize the acids in the recipe plus to add tenderness and some leavening[<a href='https://joyofbaking.com/printpages/bakingsodaprint.html' target='_blank'>Source</a>].</p><p><b>Sourdough pancakes?</b> Mix the following ingredients and let rest overnight: 240 g (1 cup) unfed <a href='sourdough_starter.html'>sourdough starter</a>, 224 g (1 cup) buttermilk(1 cup soy milk plus a curdling agent, like vinegar or lemon juice), 120 g (1 cup) whole wheat flour and 13 g (1 tbsp) sweetener. The next day before cooking the batter, add 2.5 ml (1 tsp) of vanilla extract, 3 g (1/2 tsp) salt and 6 g (1 tsp) baking soda. It's possible to use sourdough discard to make pancakes (no need to let it rest overnight), but be sure to add baking powder and baking soda to help it rise, the discard won't provide much leavening but helps to use it up while providing flavor.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/whole_wheat_pancakes.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>

<div><p>Making pizza on the stovetop is very possible(essential in our case because we don't have a oven), it is different than its oven-baked equivalent, but we think it is a great and satisfying alternative. It involves cooking the pizza dough and toppings separately (no way to broil the top of the pizza). Baking the crust on the stovetop requires the use of a heavy pan and a good lid(to help trap the heat), and it is also necessary to flip the dough at least once to ensure that it is cooked all the way through.</p><p>We have prepared pizza like this for a few years now, and are quite pleased with the result.</p><p><b>Yeast</b>. When making pizza, I use <a href='https://www.crustkingdom.com/how-much-yeast-in-pizza-dough/' target='_blank'>1&#37; yeast</a> in my dough(that's how I arrived at 2.70 g). I have a small digital scale that permits me to weigh such quantities. It is possible to use active dry yeast instead of instant (1 tsp instant = 1 1/4 tsp active), although it will be necessary the dissolve the yeast in the warm sugar water first for 5-10 minutes(until foamy) to proof it. It is not necessary to proof the yeast, you can add it directly in the flour, but in this recipe I proof my instant yeast because it is a way to ensure that the yeast is still active(it won't bloom if it isn't).</p><p><b>Cheese</b>. We don't overcomplicate things when making cheese for pizza, we like having a runny cheesy sauce, but there are <a href='https://www.noracooks.com/shreddable-vegan-mozzarella/' target='_blank'>other recipes</a> out there for melty, shreddable, plant-based cheeses. Note that the cheese won't melt unless you pop the pizza and toppings back into the cast iron pan on the stovetop at medium-high heat for an additional 5-10 minutes with a lid on.</p><p><b>Flour</b>. Evidently, it is possible to replace the portion of whole wheat flour with 100&#37; all-purpose.</p><p><b>Oven version</b>. To cook these pizzas in the oven, don't pre-cook the dough, lay it out in the desired shape(circle, or rectangle), add the toppings and bake at 230 °C (450 °F) for 15-20 minutes. For a darker top, set the oven to broil for the last 5 minutes(keep watch though). Instead of making 2 pizzas, it's possible to make <a href='../media/recipes/stovetop_pizza_03.jpg' target='_blank'>1 large one</a>.</p></div><p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_zaatar_pizza.html'>Continue reading</a></p>]]>
